</li>
<li>
<p>Ever wonder about the en-US at the end of https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/ ? The Rust homepage is in 13 different languages!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language interop is an important piece of Rust's growth.  We have C++ interop with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-bindgen">bindgen</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also node.js interop with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/RustNeon">Neon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's good Ruby/Rust interop with <a href="https://github.com/tildeio/helix">Helix</a> and others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python and Rust also have <a href="https://bheisler.github.io/post/calling-rust-in-python/">on-going interop work</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to interop, Rust has been an <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/releases/swift-4_0.md">influence on Swift</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust's focus on memory safety without performance loss has helped other languages as well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDFhvCkCLb4&amp;list=PL3jwVPmk_PRxo23yyoc0Ip_cP3-rCm7eB&amp;index=1">including D</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust has also been inspired by other languages, including a <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/08/10/Shape-of-errors-to-come.html">revamp of errors</a> inspired by Elm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust has also grown from a wide range of influences, including discussions with <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Panel-Systems-Programming-Languages-in-2014-and-Beyond">top language designers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust's 1st job was on creating browser tech.  In making Servo, Rust focused on both safety and speed, w/o one excluding the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust focuses on productivity also, <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html">leaning on ergonomics</a> for getting more done with fewer language rough edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IEEE lists Rust as the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2017">22nd most popular programming language</a>.</p>

<p>This year, according to Redmonk, Rust <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2017/03/17/language-rankings-1-17/">jumped from 47th to 26th most popular programming language</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likewise, Google trends shows Rust with (albeit a little noisy) <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0dsbpg6">comfortable growth over the last 5 years</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust is global, with heavy growth in the United States and Europe. These are the <a href="https://twitter.com/jntrnr/status/924107142595878912">meetup locations worldwide</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google trends also shows strong activity recently in <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0dsbpg6">parts of Asia</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just noticed the Rust reddit has had 16 posts in the last 24 hours. Not bad!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust just isn't a lang, but a community as well, with a focus on helpfulness. <a href="https://medium.com/@geekytwoshoes11/once-a-rustacean-always-a-rustacean-fed0a877472f">Growing this</a> is also important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to community, Rust-focused contractors like <a href="https://integer32.com/">Integer 32</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/asquera">Asquera</a> have sprung up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of, there are a number of trainers available for Rust. The <a href="https://github.com/rust-community/team">Rust community team</a> can help connect you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can make it out to one of the conferences, there are <a href="http://rustconf.com/training.html">great hands-on labs</a> there as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We've seen through multiple surveys that people stick around once they get used to Rust. It's a joy to watch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I forgot to mention, there's also an <a href="https://rust-slack.herokuapp.com/">unofficial Rust slack</a> channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As well as an <a href="https://discord.me/rust-lang">unofficial discord server</a> for Rust discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust is used commercially in a <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/2016-rust-commercial-user-survey-results/4317">wide range of areas</a>, incl. embedded systems, a/v transcoding, servers, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-impl-period-sep-18-dec-17/5676">&quot;impl period&quot;</a> is a reaction to Rust's growth. Discussions were at such a high volume that focus was needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rust team at Mozilla is spread across three continents, with most hosting meetups/talks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of meetups, if you ever have a chance to go, check out the SF Rust meetup. Lots of great talks/ideas (also free pizza!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A core piece of Rust's growth is a sense of courtesy. This comes from the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust is growing into new areas. Recently, there's been a focus on WASM support, with new tools like <a href="https://lord.io/blog/2017/wargo/">wargo</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anecdotally, I can say that I see new faces on Rust twitter regularly. More people are getting excited and sharing their adventures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A big feature for commercial adoption just landed in cargo: <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/2017-10-28-alternative-registries/">alternative registries</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Rust community has its own poet that writes limericks on the news, <a href="https://twitter.com/llogiq/status/924256412125007872">including yours truly</a>. ðŸ˜…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another fun survey fact: despite more users and releases every 6 weeks, <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/09/05/Rust-2017-Survey-Results.html">only ~7% of users had upgrade breakage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/linclark">Lin Clark</a>, who makes awesome code cartoons, wrote a popular one on the upcoming <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/08/inside-a-super-fast-css-engine-quantum-css-aka-stylo/">Firefox style system rewrite</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, speaking of, there was a followup article on WebRender, another upcoming <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/10/the-whole-web-at-maximum-fps-how-webrender-gets-rid-of-jank/">update to Firefox rendering</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While some may see Rust as largely Mozilla-driven, the Rust core team is actually made of folks from four different companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a personal note, I've been pleasantly surprised that each Rusty Spike episode has gotten <a href="https://twitter.com/jntrnr/status/924337748047048704">over 500 listens</a>, even though it's new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the place-holder for a lot of stuff we can't talk about being done by companies you might know. Wish we could talk about it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outreach to companies is exclusively grass roots by engineers in those companies promoting Rust and asking people to present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rust is growing in importance in infosec. Projects like Tor have already begun <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/tor-browser-will-feature-more-rust-code/">moving code to Rust</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">Awesome Rust</a> is well worth a shout-out. If you ever wonder about what's good in the Rust world, check it out.</p>
