blog\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/","title":""},"https://www.jntrnr.com/building-a-simple-jit-in-rust/":{"body":"The other day I threw together a simple Just-In-Time compiler (or JIT, for short), and I thought it'd be fun to show the steps I did.  With this, it should be possible to create a page of executable memory, write some machine code into it, and then treat it like a function call from Rust.\nLet's get started!  You can grab my JIT project, if you want to follow along.  I've only tested this in OS X, but it should adaptable for other platforms.\nUpdated 12/2/2015: Thanks to some reader comments, I've updated the code below to not use malloc and instead use posix_memalign directly as the allocation step, which avoids leaking memory.\nCreating executable memory\nFor our JIT, we'll need to first allocate the memory that will hold our JIT'ted code.  The most important thing here is to create a block of memory that's executable so that we can later jump into it, run code, and then return back out.\nTo do this, we need a few functions from the standard C library, which we can access through the libc external module.\n// added to Cargo.toml\n[dependencies]\nlibc = \"0.2.2\"\n\n// main.rs\nextern crate libc;\n\nOnce we've pulled in libc, we need to allocated memory.  Not just any memory, we need to allocate aligned memory.  Some operating systems, like OS X, require that executable code memory starts at a particular alignment.  For example, that the address is exactly a multiple of 0x1000.\nconst PAGE_SIZE: usize = 4096;\n// ...\nunsafe {\n  let mut page : *mut libc::c_void = mem::uninitialized();\n  libc::posix_memalign(&amp;mut page, PAGE_SIZE, size);\n}\n\nOnce allocated, we now have memory we can safely jump to.  Well, almost.  Before we can run code in our newly-allocated memory, we need to enable executing code in this area of memory.\nunsafe {\n  libc::mprotect(page, size, libc::PROT_EXEC | libc::PROT_READ | libc::PROT_WRITE);\n}\n\nNow we're ready.  We have something we can write into and then jump into.  Since running JIT code is basically \"no man's land\" without any safeguards, it's easy to get yourself in trouble.  One step that I add is to also fill the memory block with the RET instruction, which will let us return from our function even if we happen to accidentally run other memory in the block.\nextern {\n    fn memset(s: *mut libc::c_void, c: libc::uint32_t, n: libc::size_t) -&gt; *mut libc::c_void;\n}\n// ...\nunsafe {\n  memset(page, 0xc3, size);  // prepopulate with 'RET' calls (0xc3)\n}\n\nWe've allocated our JIT memory, aligned it, set it as executable, and then filled it with the RET instruction.  We're ready to write some code into it.\nNote: You'll notice we don't explicitly call libc::free() after we allocate.  For simplicity, we treat the JIT'ed functions we create as long-lived, but a full-blown JIT would likely use better memory hygiene.\nGetting ready to write our first program\nTo write our first JIT program, let's first make a way to more easily work with our memory.  In its current state, it's a raw C void* pointer, but this is a bit unweildy as we don't have a lot of support to work with that in Rust.  To make something that feels more natural, we'll create a new struct type that will hold our pointer and allow us to create indexing functions for easier access.  This will let us access the memory like m[0] = 0x10.\nLet's create the struct we'll use:\nuse std::mem;\n\nstruct JitMemory {\n    contents : *mut u8\n}\n\nfn alloc() -&gt; JitMemory {\n  let contents: mut* u8;\n  unsafe {\n    //note: allocate 'page' as before\n    \n    //then, transmute\n    contents = mem::transmute(page);\n  }\n  \n  JitMemory { contents: contents }\n}\n\nWe've got the JitMemory struct which will hold the memory we've allocated, and we use the mem::transmute call to convert our raw void pointer to a raw u8 pointer, which will be easier to work with in our next step.\nNow that we have the struct, let's create some indexing functions.\nuse std::ops::{Index, IndexMut};\n\nimpl Index&lt;usize&gt; for JitMemory {\n    type Output = u8;\n\n    fn index(&amp;self, _index: usize) -&gt; &amp;u8 {\n        unsafe {&amp;*self.contents.offset(_index as isize) }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl IndexMut&lt;usize&gt; for JitMemory {\n    fn index_mut(&amp;mut self, _index: usize) -&gt; &amp;mut u8 {\n        unsafe {&amp;mut *self.contents.offset(_index as isize) }\n    }\n}\n\nWith these in place, we can now more easily write instructions into memory.  Before we do, let's put everything we'd done so far into a constructor for our struct:\nimpl JitMemory {\n  fn new(num_pages: usize) -&gt; JitMemory {\n    let contents : *mut u8;\n    unsafe {\n      let size = num_pages * PAGE_SIZE;\n      let mut _contents : *mut libc::c_void = mem::uninitialized(); // avoid uninitalized warning\n      libc::posix_memalign(&amp;mut _contents, PAGE_SIZE, size);\n      libc::mprotect(_contents, size, libc::PROT_EXEC | libc::PROT_READ | libc::PROT_WRITE);\n\n      memset(_contents, 0xc3, size);  // for now, prepopulate with 'RET'\n\n      contents = mem::transmute(_contents);\n    }\n\n    JitMemory { contents: contents }        \n  }\n}\nWriting our first JIT program\nWith our new constructor and indexing functions in place, we can write our first JIT program.  The simplest \"hello world\" that I use when doing JIT is a function that takes no parameters and returns a simple value.\nWe can do this with two assembly instructions:\nMOV RAX, 0x3  ; move our return value (0x3) into RAX, \n              ; the register in x64 used for return values\nRET           ; return from the function call\n\nGreat, now we just need to write this program into our JIT memory.  But wait, we don't have an assembler :)\nNot to fear, there are plenty of assemblers to get us started.  There are even online assemblers you can use.  Let's plug the first line MOV RAX, 0x3 into our online assembler.\nThe top line of the result is the raw hex.  This is what we want.  These are the actual bits we'll be writing into memory for our function: 48C7C003000000\nWith these bytes, and the RET instruction we already filled our memory with, we now have our full function.  We can use our indexing functions to write this out:\nlet mut jit : JitMemory = JitMemory::new(1);  // allocate a page of memory\n\njit[0] = 0x48;  // mov RAX, 0x3\njit[1] = 0xc7;\njit[2] = 0xc0;\njit[3] = 0x03;\njit[4] = 0x00;\njit[5] = 0x00;\njit[6] = 0x00;\nTurning our memory into a function\nWe have an executable block of memory with the code for our function filled in.  The last step is to turn this into a Rust function we can call.  We do this by doing another mem::transmute:\nfn run_jit() -&gt; (fn() -&gt; i64) {\n  let mut jit : JitMemory = JitMemory::new(1);\n\n  jit[0] = 0x48;  // mov RAX, 0x3\n  jit[1] = 0xc7;\n  jit[2] = 0xc0;\n  jit[3] = 0x03;\n  jit[4] = 0x00;\n  jit[5] = 0x00;\n  jit[6] = 0x00;\n\n  unsafe { mem::transmute(jit.contents) }\n}\n\nAnd with that, after a few handfuls of unsafe calls and transmutes, we have our function.  The only thing left is to call it:\nfn main() {\n  let fun = run_jit();\n  println!(\"{}\", fun());\n}\nDebugging\nWhen working with a JIT, it's inevitable at some point something will go wrong, and we'll need to dive into the debugger.  Luckily, Rust works with LLDB out of the box.\nHere are some helpful LLDB commands to get you started:\nStart the JIT in LLDB:\nlldb target/debug/rustyjit\nSet a breakpoint for the line that contains the call into our JIT code:\n&gt; br set -line 64\nRun to our breakpoint:\n&gt; run\nNow that we're about to run our JIT code, there are a few things we can do.\nThe first one is to verify the address of our code:\n&gt; p fun\nUnfortunately, that's not the most helpful thing in the world.  What we often want is look at the memory behind the function:\n&gt; mem read fun\nThis gives us back something like this:\n0x100804000: 48 c7 c0 03 00 00 00 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3  H??....?????????\n0x100804010: c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3 c3  ????????????????\n\nThat's better.  Now we can see if the bytes we expect to be there are in fact there.  If we wanted, we could update memory using mem write if something was out of place.\nWe can also use the built in disassembler to read back out what the asm instructions are for our function:\n&gt; dis -A x64 -s fun\nFinally, we can continue with the program:\n&gt; cont\nLots ahead\nNow that we have a tiny JIT and a way to debug it, the sky is the limit.  Turning source code into machine code is the heart of any compiler, and with these few additional steps that compiler could be made to output code that we can run directly.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/building-a-simple-jit-in-rust/","title":"Building a simple JIT in Rust"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-traits/":{"body":"One of the first things you might notice about Rust, if you come to it from other OOP-style languages, is that Rust separates methods from the data they work on.  You create your struct, then you impl a few methods on it later.\nstruct Rect {\n    height: i32,\n    width: i32\n}\n\nimpl Rect {\n    fn area(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 { self.height * self.width }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let r = Rect { height: 10, width: 5 };\n    println!(\"area: {}\", r.area());\n}\n\nWhich, to me, seemed slightly awkward at first.  But, as I dug in a little futher, I started asking questions like \"Can I do that to existing types?  Even basic types like the String type?\"  Indeed you can.  In this post we'll see some of what's possible.\nWarning: we're going down a rabbit hole under the influence of the Bad Idea Bears.  I hope you have your snorkel. :)\nWarming up\nWe've talked a little about the basics already.  In Rust, impl gives us a way to \"add\" methods onto types.  But, when we try to do the same thing to String, we hit a snag:\nimpl String {\n    fn my_len(&amp;self) -&gt; usize { self.len() }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let name = \"foo\".to_string();\n\n    println!(\"my length: {}\", name.my_len());\n}\n\nWhen we try to compile this, the compiler gives us back an error:\nmylen.rs:1:1: 3:2 error: cannot define inherent `impl` for a type outside of the crate where the type is defined; define and implement a trait or new type instead [E0116]\nmylen.rs:1 impl String {\nmylen.rs:2     fn my_len(&amp;self) -&gt; usize { self.len() }\nmylen.rs:3 }\n\nSo we can't impl for a type outside of... oh wait.  We can do it, so long as we give it a trait to work with.\nTry #2:\ntrait MyLen {\n    fn my_len(&amp;self) -&gt; usize;\n}\n\nimpl MyLen for String {\n    fn my_len(&amp;self) -&gt; usize { self.len() }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let name = \"foo\".to_string();\n\n    println!(\"my length: {}\", name.my_len());\n}\n\nWoah, that worked!  With that, we peek into the rabbit hole.\nTraits and extending strings\nTo kick off our explorations, let's give ourselves an example to use.  Let's say we want to read in the contents of some file, and we get the filename for that file from the commandline.\nuse std::io::Error;\n\nfn read_all(fname: String) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt; {\n    use std::fs::File;\n    use std::io::prelude::*;\n\n    let mut contents = String::new();\n    let mut f = try!(File::open(fname));\n    try!(f.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents));\n    Ok(contents)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    use std::env::args; \n\n    if let Some(fname) = args().nth(1) {\n        if let Ok(contents) = read_all(fname) {\n            println!(\"{}\", contents);\n        }\n    }\n} \n\nWouldn't it be nice to not mix and match helper functions and methods?  Wouldn't it read a little nicer to havefname.read_all()?\nUsing the same pattern we used before, this is pretty easy to do. \nuse std::io::Error;\n\ntrait FileReader {\n    fn read_all(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt;;\n}\n\nimpl FileReader for str {\n    fn read_all(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt; {\n        use std::fs::File;\n        use std::io::prelude::*;\n\n        let mut contents = String::new();\n        let mut f = try!(File::open(self));\n        try!(f.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents));\n        Ok(contents)\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    use std::env::args; \n\n    if let Some(fname) = args().nth(1) {\n        if let Ok(contents) = fname.read_all() {\n            println!(\"{}\", contents);\n        }\n    }\n}    \n\nThat's not bad!  Go get my nth argument, check if we're good, then read the contents.\nIf we could stop ourselves there, we'd be mostly okay.  Our example is still pretty readable, though we might get a few dirty looks from the senior devs in the lunch line.\nTraits and extending Option\nThe Bad Idea Bears call us deeper!  Can we play a little code \"golf\" and squeeze out using Option in our main?  Sure!  All we need to do is create another impl for our FileReader trait, this time for Option (specifically those that contain Strings):\nuse std::io::Error;\n\ntrait FileReader {\n    fn read_all(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt;;\n}\n\nimpl FileReader for str {\n    fn read_all(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt; {\n        use std::fs::File;\n        use std::io::prelude::*;\n\n        let mut contents = String::new();\n        let mut f = try!(File::open(self));\n        try!(f.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents));\n        Ok(contents)\n    }\n}\n\nimpl FileReader for Option&lt;String&gt; {\n    fn read_all(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt; {\n        use std::io::ErrorKind;\n        match *self {\n            Option::None =&gt; Err(Error::new(ErrorKind::NotFound, \n                \"No such file or directory\")),\n            Option::Some(ref s) =&gt; s.read_all()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    use std::env::args; \n    \n    if let Ok(contents) = args().nth(1).read_all() {\n        println!(\"{}\", contents);\n    }\n}\n\nYay!  Our main is smaller, and we've still managed to maintain at least a little of our decency.  I mean, we could have used unwrap, and thrown care to the wind!  Instead, we're still doing error-checking on our contents. Albeit, our error-checking is kinda smooshed into one place.\nWhat's that, Bad Idea Bear?  We should go further?  Okay!\nTraits and extending iterators\nWe're doing a read_all() on the Option, but what if we go right to the arguments themselves?\nIf we poke around in the docs, we find out that args() returns its own type, Args. As we read on we see that Args is just an Iterator.\nThat gives us a couple choices.  We can implement a new trait on Args:\ntrait FileReaderIter {\n    fn read_nth(&amp;mut self, pos: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt;;\n}\n\nimpl FileReaderIter for Args {\n    fn read_nth(&amp;mut self, pos: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt; {\n        self.nth(pos).read_all()\n    }    \n}\n\nOr, we can work with Iterator:\ntrait FileReaderIter : Iterator&lt;Item=String&gt; + Sized {\n    fn read_nth(&amp;mut self, pos: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;String, Error&gt; {\n        self.nth(pos).read_all()\n    }\n}\n\nimpl FileReaderIter for Args {}\n\nLet's actually stop here for a minute and look at this one.  We can't extend Iterator itself.  This is a Good Thing(tm), because if we could, we would end up having to extend countless implementors of Iterator.  Instead, we need to create a new trait that extends from Iterator.\nNext, we need to say what kind of iterator we can work on.  We know ahead of time that this works on specifically iterators over Strings.  We use the &lt;Item=String&gt; to lock that knowledge in place for the compiler.  This is called an associated type.\nWith the new trait and associated type, we're almost done.  Lastly, we're doing something a little different this time around.  We have a default implementation inside of the trait instead of just having a prototype.  A default implementation saves you the trouble of having to repeat yourself with each type that implements the trait, if the function is general and trivial.\nThe gotcha is that if you use a default implementation that uses self, the compiler needs to know how big self will be because it will pass it by-value.  Hence, anything that implements FileReaderIter must have a known size so the compiler knows how many bytes to copy in when self is passed to the method.  To ensure this, we add another trait to inherit from, Sized.  With that, we can say that Args trivially implements this trait.\nPhew, okay, that's it.  What have we gotten for our effort? \nBoth approaches give us this simple main:\nfn main() {\n    use std::env::args;\n\n    if let Ok(contents) = args().read_nth(1) {\n        println!(\"{}\", contents);    \n    }\n}\n\nAt this point we're far enough down in the rabbit hole that there's only a pinpoint of light from the entrance. \nLet's work our way back out, shall we?\n(ps: if you want to follow Bad Idea Bear further, this little nugget is hidden in the Rust docs: both Result and Option implement iterator traits and can be used as iterators)\nClimbing back out of the rabbit hole\nCleverness and readability often trade off with each other.  As we tried to get more clever and squeeze our main down, the end result became more code we had to maintain.  We also increased the amount of 'magic' we used, whether it was treating multiple failure styles/cases as one case or the amount of additional capabilities we were giving types like String and Option.\nRust's trait system is powerful and clever.  It lets you express the algorithms that are core to your project in a way that can even extend the basic Rust API.  Indeed, that's one reason why the Rust language and core libraries are intentionally kept pretty small and tidy: so you can make these kind of additions (using eg. modules from creates.io) and the standard library doesn't get in your way.\nBut, as they say, with great power comes great opportunities to follow Bad Idea Bears down rabbit holes.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-traits/","title":"Going down the rabbit hole with Rust traits"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/embedded-scripting-in-rust/":{"body":"For the last few weeks, I've been working on an embedded scripting language for Rust, based loosely on ChaiScript called Rhai.  What's an embedded scripting language?  While the definition might depend on who you ask, for this post embedded scripting has a few distinct features: \n\nA language that derives all functionality from bindings to the hosting environment\nAs a result, it allows complete control over the API exposed to the script, letting you lock down the script to your application's needs\n\nIn short, it's like the little brother of a full scripting language.  It's smaller, thinner, but still useful for a variety of apps.\nBecause I'm using Rust as the host language, I also put a few other constraints on the project to make it work with a wider range of use cases.\n\nNo use of 'unsafe' - this lets us script where security is a concern\nNo additional dependencies - keeps our design small\nEasy-to-use - even being safe and lightweight, it still needs to be easy to get started\n\nIntroducing: Rhai\nLet's take a look at what Rhai looks like, then we'll break down how it works.\nHello world\nAs I mentioned earlier, one of the goals with Rhai was to have minimal setup to get going.  This example is a full \"hello world\" of scripting that evaluates some script and gives us the result:\nextern crate rhai;\nuse rhai::Engine;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut engine = Engine::new();\n\n    if let Ok(result) = engine.eval(\"40 + 2\".to_string())\n        .unwrap().downcast::&lt;i32&gt;() {\n        \n        println!(\"Answer: {}\", *result);  // prints 42\n    }\n}\n\nLooking a little closer.  We pull in the Rhai crate and get the scripting engine into view:\nextern crate rhai;\nuse rhai::Engine;\n\nNext, we create an instance of the engine:\nlet mut engine = Engine::new();\n\nFinally, we call into the engine.  Perhaps the most interesting part here is the roundtrip.  The 'eval' method takes a String, and returns a Result&lt;Box&lt;Any&gt;, EvalAltResult&gt;.  Because we're in a scripting context, everything we're working with is dynamically typed, so as values get passed around, we make liberal use of Box&lt;Any&gt;.  Here, the expression \"40 + 2\" is going to evaluated to give us a Box'ed number.  Of course, we can also have errors occur during script execution, so we need to return a Result.\nTo go from a Result to the actual numeric value, we have to take a few steps to peel away the layers.  I cheat and use 'unwrap' to get through the Result, then the downcast takes us from a Box&lt;Any&gt; to a Box&lt;i32&gt;.\nengine.eval(\"40 + 2\".to_string()).unwrap().downcast::&lt;i32&gt;()\n\nThat's it.  We've done a full round trip of creating script and then making sense of its output.  The language, at this point, has only basic functionality because we haven't registered anything the script can use.  So let's fix that.\nRegistering your functions\nTo make your functions visible to the script, you'll need to register them with the script engine.  Let's do the same example, but this time we'll create an add function in our native code and call it from script:\nextern crate rhai;\nuse rhai::{Engine, FnRegister};\n\nfn add(x: i32, y: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    x + y\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut engine = Engine::new();\n\n    &amp;(add as fn(x: i32, y: i32)-&gt;i32).register(&amp;mut engine, \"add\");\n\n    if let Ok(result) = engine.eval(\"add(40, 2)\".to_string())\n        .unwrap().downcast::&lt;i32&gt;() {\n        \n        println!(\"Answer: {}\", *result);  // prints 42\n    }\n}\n\nThe big change in this example is this line:\n&amp;(add as fn(x: i32, y: i32)-&gt;i32).register(&amp;mut engine, \"add\");\n\nThis uses the function registration capability taken from the FnRegister trait that we've added to our imports.  It's a trait implemenented on functions which gives them a register method.  We call the method and pass into it both our engine and the name we want the function to be called in script.  With that, we're good to go and can call the function.\nLet's do two more examples so we can see how some of the other details play out.\nFunction overloading\nRhai also has supported for function overloading.  This gives you a way to work with generic functions (like the example below) or to register multiple functions to the same name.  During call resolution, the engine will call these functions and will fall through to the case that matches the types at runtime.\nuse std::fmt::Display;\n\nextern crate rhai;\nuse rhai::{Engine, FnRegister};\n\nfn showit&lt;T: Display&gt;(x: &amp;mut T) -&gt; () {\n    println!(\"{}\", x)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut engine = Engine::new();\n\n    &amp;(showit as fn(x: &amp;mut i32)-&gt;()).register(&amp;mut engine, \"print\");\n    &amp;(showit as fn(x: &amp;mut bool)-&gt;()).register(&amp;mut engine, \"print\");\n    &amp;(showit as fn(x: &amp;mut String)-&gt;()).register(&amp;mut engine, \"print\");\n}\nWorking with custom types\nFinally, in addition to working with your functions, Rhai also supports working with custom types.  In this example, we introduce a few more features.  First, you can register functions that take a &amp;mut as their first argument.  This allows them to be used as methods in the script.  Next, we register a special getter function.  This lets us read (or write, if we register a setter also) the member directly in script.\nYou'll notice too that we make sure our object is clone-able.  As we'll talk about in the next section, this ends up being a requirement when working with values in the script engine.  We make sure to register our custom type with the engine to make cloning possible from inside the engine.\nextern crate rhai;\nuse rhai::{Engine, FnRegister};\n\n#[derive(Clone)]\nstruct TestStruct {\n    x: i32\n}\n\nimpl TestStruct {\n    fn update(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.x += 1000;\n    }\n\n    fn get_x(&amp;mut self) -&gt; i32 { self.x }\n\n    fn new() -&gt; TestStruct {\n        TestStruct { x: 1 }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut engine = Engine::new();\n\n    engine.register_type::&lt;TestStruct&gt;();\n\n    &amp;(TestStruct::new as fn()-&gt;TestStruct).register(&amp;mut engine, \"new_ts\");\n\n    &amp;(TestStruct::update as fn(&amp;mut TestStruct)-&gt;())\n        .register(&amp;mut engine, \"update\");\n    &amp;(TestStruct::get_x as fn(&amp;mut TestStruct)-&gt;i32)\n        .register(&amp;mut engine, \"get$x\");\n\n    if let Ok(result) = \n        engine.eval(\"var myts = new_ts(); myts.update(); myts.x\".to_string())\n            .unwrap().downcast::&lt;i32&gt;() {\n        \n        println!(\"result: {}\", *result); // prints 1001\n    }\n}\nHow it works\nLet's take a look at how the scripting engine works.  There may be even better ways to do some of these steps, so I'm eager to hear your feedback.\nWithout further ado, let's jump in.\nFunction resolution\nThe heart of the system is the function resolver.  In Rhai, all function calls, even all operators like plus and minus, end up going through the resolver.  Yet, it's a relatively simple piece of code.\n\nFirst, find all functions which match the name.  Let's say 'foo'\nFor each 'foo' function, try to call the function with the argument(s) given\nIf it succeeds, return the resulting value\nIf it fails, continue trying the rest of the functions registered to 'foo'\nIf none succeed, error\n\nGoing through all the functions which match a name gives us the ability to do overloaded functions.  It also lets us do operators, which themselves are commonly overloaded.\nFunction registration\nThe next piece to working with functions in the engine is registering them.  There are two kinds of functions that are registered: inner functions, or those created inside the script itself, and external functions, or those created in the native code.\nInner functions are relatively simple.  They work by creating a new scope, adding the function arguments to this new scope, and then executing the function body.\nExternal functions, if you will, are where the magic happens.  Here, we handle the boundary between the scripting world and the native world.\nLet's look at how to register a function with one pass-by-value argument fn(T)-&gt;U:\nimpl&lt;T: Any+Clone, U: Any+Clone&gt; FnRegister for fn(T)-&gt;U {\n    fn register(self, engine: &amp;mut Engine, name: &amp;str) {        \n        let wrapped : Box&lt;Fn(&amp;mut Box&lt;Any&gt;)-&gt;Result&lt;Box&lt;Any&gt;, EvalAltResult&gt;&gt; = \n            Box::new(\n                move |arg: &amp;mut Box&lt;Any&gt;| {\n                    let inside = (*arg).downcast_mut() as Option&lt;&amp;mut T&gt;;\n                    match inside {\n                        Some(b) =&gt; Ok(Box::new(self(b.clone())) as Box&lt;Any&gt;),\n                        None =&gt; Err(EvalAltResult::ErrorFunctionArgMismatch)\n                    }\n                }\n            );\n\n        let ent = engine.fns.entry(name.to_string()).or_insert(Vec::new());\n        (*ent).push(FnType::ExternalFn1(wrapped));\n    }\n}\n\nThere's a lot going on, so let's break it down:\nimpl&lt;T: Any+Clone, U: Any+Clone&gt; FnRegister for fn(T)-&gt;U\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, all the types used in the scripting engine need to be clone-able.  We enforce that here as well because we'll use the clone feature in the call.  We are implementing the FnRegister trait on all functions that match this constraint.\nNext, we are going to create a wrapper function which will call the function given:\nlet wrapped : Box&lt;Fn(&amp;mut Box&lt;Any&gt;)-&gt;Result&lt;Box&lt;Any&gt;, EvalAltResult&gt;&gt;\n\nAll functions of arity one have this internal wrapper function, regardless of if they are pass by value or reference.  This lets us work through a vector of functions easily during function resolution, without having to have too much information out the specific type of the function.\nNext, we have the wrapper function itself:\nBox::new(\n    move |arg: &amp;mut Box&lt;Any&gt;| {\n        let inside = (*arg).downcast_mut() as Option&lt;&amp;mut T&gt;;\n        match inside {\n            Some(b) =&gt; Ok(Box::new(self(b.clone())) as Box&lt;Any&gt;),\n            None =&gt; Err(EvalAltResult::ErrorFunctionArgMismatch)\n        }\n    }\n);\n\nThe wrapper is a closure that moves its environment. In this case, it's moving the function we're wrapping.  Once it has ownership, we can safely return the wrapper and complete registration.\nInside the closure, we handle working with the argument.  Because we know the type of the function during registration, we use this knowledge to downcast the argument and give it the proper type.  If this succeeds, we know we have the correct function and can call it.  If it fails, we know this isn't a match and later can try the next function in the overloads.\nTo call the function, since we're pass by value, we need to take the extra cloning step to get to a value rather than a reference.  This lets us respect the ownership model, albeit at the cost of the clone.\nThat's the heart of how the resolution system works.  Resolution works through each possible match, and registration gives us a wrapper function that can try each function against the types known at compile time.\nThe rest of the story\nMany of the remaining features built on these two main components.  As mentioned earlier, when you register special get and set functions for fields, the engine will use them when you work with the fields in script.\nThe engine will register a set of basic arithmetic and comparison operators to get started with.  These also use the same function resolution mechanism.\nFor variables, the engine works by passing a scope stack around.  For lookup, in order to follow the ownership rules (and maintain pass-by-value semantics), we clone variable values when they're used in an expression.  During assignment, we use a mutable reference to their value in the scope stack so that it can be updated with the right-hand side of the assignment.\nWhat's next?\nRhai is still very young and has a bit of growing to do before it's ready for primetime.  Parsing and error reporting are barebones and don't have the kind of error recovery you'd expect from more industrial-strength scripting.  There are also a number of convenience features that would be relatively easy to add, like vectors, iterators, for..in.., and so on.\nIf you'd like to help out, jump over to the GitHub site.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/embedded-scripting-in-rust/","title":"Embedded scripting in Rust"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/exit-codes/":{"body":"Before starting a shell, if you would have asked me what an exit code was, I would have quickly replied \"0 for success, non-zero for failure\" without batting an eye. That's what it meant, right?\nToday, someone filed an issue on the Nushell repo. In it, they ran git log, exited, and Nushell reported the command to have failed.\nTo know why it happens, we've got to do some digging. First, let's take a look at the standards to understand what we should expect.\nWhat the standard says\nBash\nOne of the first places you'll learn about exit codes is the Bash manual. It says:\n\"A successful command returns a 0, while an unsuccessful one returns a non-zero value that usually may be interpreted as an error code. Well-behaved UNIX commands, programs, and utilities return a 0 exit code upon successful completion, though there are some exceptions.\" (emph. mine)\nPOSIX\nThe POSIX Open Group Base standard says:\n\"The value of status may be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, [CX] [Option Start]  or any other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is, status &amp; 0377) shall be available from wait() and waitpid(); the full value shall be available from waitid() and in the siginfo_t passed to a signal handler for SIGCHLD. [Option End]\"\nOn the same page it says: \"The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2017 defers to the ISO C standard.\"\nISO C\nOkay, so what's the ISO C standard say?\n\"If the value of status is zero or EXIT_SUCCESS, an implementation-defined form of the status successful termination is returned. If the value of status is EXIT_FAILURE, an implementation-defined form of the status unsuccessful termination is returned. Otherwise the status returned is implementation-defined.\"\n\"an implementation-defined form of the status unsuccessful termination is returned\" feels unsatisfying, but at least we know that non-zero means unsuccessful, right?\nThe bug\nThe original report was about git log. Let's run the steps the user reports: run git log, quit with q, and then check the exit code. I'll do this in bash, since that's the shell everyone will have access to:\n&gt; git log\n&gt; echo $?\n141\n\nSure enough, a non-zero exit code.\nBash is reporting that git log exits with exit code 141. This clearly feels intentional. It's not a 0 or 1, but a number specific to the other 254 possibilities.\nTurns out that some folks dug into this 5+ years ago. They write a bullet list with their findings:\n\nGit pipes the logs into less\nI quit the less process, which sends a SIGPIPE signal (13) to the underlying git process streaming the logs\ngit catches the interrupt and exits prematurely and per POSIX convention returns 128 + the SIGPIPE status ==&gt; 141 to indicate that it was terminated by signal 13. \n\nWhen failures aren't failures\nWhy is the user being told about the SIGPIPE in this case? I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable set of events that take us to this point. Git is calling out to less, and less wants to report the user quitting it ends the pipe prematurely. And yet, it definitely feels to fall short of the spirit of the specifications. Non-zero errors should mean we've exited in an unexpected way. The steps above exit us in about the only reasonable way to exit interactively viewing the log.\nAs it turns out, git log isn't alone. Here's a discussion on Stack Overflow about grep -q returning 141. In it, the responses point out yet other commands, like head, also return 141 in their regular course of action.\nThere are standards, and there are standards\nSomething folks tend to assume is that the POSIX standard covers a lot of how Unix-like systems work. While this is true at some level, there are cases like this one where we quickly shift to having to lean more on conventions than standards. As the Bash manual says \"though there are some exceptions\". Using pipes and command composition leads to having to follow one part of the standard that in turn leads to really confusing situations for the user, like the situations listed above. A command like head or less doesn't take all of its inputs. As it closes, it passes along that \"hey, technically the pipe I was reading from isn't going to be able to write to its output because I'm closing\". From the user's perspective, though, exiting early is exactly what's supposed to happen. It's not actually an error.\nIt kinda makes you wonder - if we could do this over again, how would we do it differently?\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/exit-codes/","title":"Let's talk about exit codes"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/fun-facts-about-rust-growth/":{"body":"\n\nThere are now 100 friends of Rust (Be sure to hover to learn about how each company uses Rust)\n\n\nThere are now 3 Rust podcasts: New Rustacean, Rusty Spike, and Request for Explanation\n\n\nFirst year had one conference, the second year had three, and this year had four.\n\n\ncrates.io is not even 3 years old, but already the number of crates has passed CRAN(R) and Hackage(Haskell).\n\n\nThe Rust reddit is now over 29,000 Rustaceans strong.\n\n\nthe #rust irc channel has grown to over 1300 people\n\n\nThe Rust gitter channel is over 1800 people.\n\n\nour first Rust survey had 3,086 responses.

HandmadeCon is the first convention for the Handmade Hero project by Casey Muratori, a game industry gun-for-hire who most recently worked on The Witness, the follow-up game for Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid.\nKey takeaways\nThere was a ton of material in the interviews.  Enough so that I suspect if two people wrote down their takeaways, they might have wildly different lists.  Still, here are the takeaways I had:\n\nQuick iteration is king.  Working towards faster turnaround time is going to deeply impact overall quality.\nLock-in fundamental game choices as early as possible.  Examples: game controls for platforming, game speed for open-world.  These impact how you design levels, and any change may cause you to have to redo levels, puzzles, assets, etc.\nTo work in the game industry you need to show both self-motivated passion and curiosity. The rest can be learned.\n\nFormat\n\nCasey (right) interviewing Jonathan Blow\nCasey has hand-picked a list of game developers with deep technical experience for the conference.  With each developer, he interviewed them about their strengths and would tease out the key points from the discussion, often drilling in to learn more.  I hadn't heard of some of the people he'd picked, but I quickly realized he'd hand-selected each for their specific expertise in gaming, whether controls, code layout, networking, design, or ingenuity.\nTommy Refenes\nSuper Meat Boy\nKey quote(s)\n\n\"Best way to get the best work out of people is to give people a way to give you the best work\"\n\nAssets pipeline\n\nOriginal asset pipeline used JSFL to output texture files with indexing from the Adobe Flash tools\nNow he just works with the SWF directly.  He (gasp) read the SWF manuals.\n\nMovement\n\nSpent three months perfecting controls using a square that jumped around the screen\nMovement was built on a set of hand-coded equations whose parameters were tweaked until everything felt right.  He offhandedly called these \"garbage numbers/equations\"\nRather than being real-world, everything was based on how it played\n\nEg) 200ms of grace time where meat boy sticks to the wall, allowing you to press the other way and then hit the jump button, or vice versa, to initiate a wall jump\n\n\nAfter the initial controls tuning, they were locked in and did not change for the rest of the development\nThis allowed level design to build on the controls\nExplored things like analog, but ended up going digital.  Reasons: never want a \"half jump\" or a slow acceleration\n\nTesting\n\nFans are the best testers\nPC is crazy complex, and you're bound to bake in some hardware configuration assumptions\nHe's working on crowd-sourced alpha/beta testing platform that he can ship builds out to specific testers\n\nMike Acton\nInsomniac [creators of Ratchet and Clank]\nKey quote(s)\n\n\"Adding stuff to the problem does not make the problem simpler\"\n\"Everytime I hear 'I can just optimize at the end' I want to slap someone\"  Probably a chain of failures lead to this.\n\"Capture and visualize\" your data.  Actually look at the data. eg) build tools to look at the spacial queries that developers are running.\n\nReaction to Tommy\n\nMike started off with a few reactions to Tommy's interview.\nTommy's input style isn't garbage, it is real and it fits the input of his movements and output of \"Tommy smiles\"\nDoing things that are \"real world\" may actually just be the wrong answer and move you the wrong direction\nHe whole-heartedly agreed about locking down controls so you can lock down how levels are made\nOn a related note: ovement speed, esp in an open-world game, greatly affect how the engine works because of streaming off disk, etc\nRead the CPU manuals\nBTW, docs are seriously important. Doc your own internal formats, too. This is your key input.\nAlso, focus on your own problem and your own game.  Too many indie devs mimicking other frameworks/tools.\n\nHiring a game developer\n\nMain corollary for game developer success: curiosity\nDemonstrate what you've done with your own willpower\nLearn how to practice, and take practice seriously.  Anything else is an excuse. Your career is one of the most important things in your life, up there with family.\nPractice with the goal of getting better/faster and solving the problem.  Throw it away rather than keeping it.  If it's practice, it's not a project.  You're honing a skill rather than building a thing.\n\nPat Wyatt\nGuild Wars, Diablo, StarCraft and more\nKey quote(s)\n\n\"Make your iteration speed as fast as you can, because this will determine the quality of your game\"\n\nEarly network stacks\n\nSynchronized network models where client and server both had game state and were kept in lock-step\nWarcraft: RTS are not so twitchy, don't need to see effect simultaneously\nEg) 4 network moves per second, and a move is when you've heard from everyone\nStarcraft similar to Warcraft\n\nDiablo on Battle.Net\n\nMove from singleplayer to real-time multiplayer\nFirst idea: Synchronized at first, to help prevent cheating\nIdeally, network model should be separate from UI data, since one is updated by network, and one by the client, and they may be updated at different times\nProblem with synchonized client/server: if you don't do it perfectly, you diverge and it's hard to debug\nDiablo written too quickly to do a synchronized version\nSolution: \"Asynchronous loosely-coupled game\"\nEach level has a 'master', and the master is the consensus driver for world state for that level\nReplayable log of state that can be given to a new master if the first one drops out\nGame host declares who is master for a given level based on who first entered that level\nState change happens in two steps: \"I am attempting to pick up the sword\" then master plays through all attempts and break ties\nDON'T DO A GAME LIKE THIS.  People will cheat.\n\nGriefers will take advantage\nAsk yourself: \"How will people hack this?\" \"How will people abuse others?\"\n\n\n\nGuild Wars\n\nAll client/server, all TCP\nNetwork functionality split across many servers\nFile server: handles versions and creates deltas based on what client has available, compresses, and sends update to client for assets in the manifest \nAsset ids automatically assigned by perforce full path\nFile servers were put near users because this helps throughput.  Related: tcp window and waiting for ack for each packet\nLobby server: authentication and presence.  Arena, instance, etc all controlled through lobby server because you don't have a persistent connection.  Helps with p2p messages, guild msgs etc, encryption\nMatchmaking server: will match up servers with capacity with needs of user\nUsing tons of servers allows you scale up and distribute across machines\nNetwork code is shared across all servers.  Every server is actually a generic modular server.  It just hotloads the specific module.  eg) lobby server just loads the lobby module\nNeed RPC protocol that supports versioning.  These days, things like protocol buffers would work fine.\n\nUDP vs TCP\n\nMobile - UDP works great, since you're already going to be losing packets \nMMO - TCP is great because you don't want to lose packets\n\nNetwork game states\n\nFailure is always legal. Eg) can't load model file, you don't crash.  Instead you get a white box\nServer is authoritative and may pull players back to acceptable state.  Also, every client sees their version of the server truth, like the arrow that \"bends in space\" because target moved\n\nBest practices\n\nAlways simulate network jitter and latency, minimum 200ms, so you are always creating robust networking code\nYou will always be hacked\n\nDeeply understand your interaction model\nRate limiting helps prevent abuse\nHiding IP addresses so they can't be targetted for attacks like DDOS\n\n\n\nHiring a game developer\n\nDemonstrate passion\nRead \"cracking the coding interview\"\n\nJonathan Blow\nBraid, The Witness\n\nIteration is king.  More you optimize the less you can modify.\nProgramming for fungibility to allow for faster iteration.\nProgram for a decoupled system, as much as possible.  This includes game mechanics, types of puzzles, etc\nDoing programming as a game designer, you can more closely point the best way forward in the game design as you know exactly what's possible\nProgramming as a designer also helps you explore more of the design space than you might otherwise have.  Eg) in Braid the enemies unaffected by your time travel.\nGood design can often be a search space with a seed value and things that seem like time wasted, but that's part of the journey.\n\nRon Gilbert\nSecret of Monkey Island, creator of SCUMM\n\nFor Maniac Mansion, C64 was hooked to a Unix/Vax machine with hotloading to C64.  This is how they could swap out and do fast iterations\nTo learn how to do an interpreter, he banked out BASIC ROM to RAM and then manipulated it.  Cool hack.\nFor pathfinding, used dijkstra's algorithm with rectangle shapes.  This evolved over time.\nLater games used seamlessly stiched-together soundtracks that changed as the player progressed.\nCutscenes, which came from Lucasfilm games, were originally hand-scripted.  They had to \"cheat\" a little so the player couldn't interrupt the cutscene with their own movement.  Eg) Making the character the player was following appear far enough ahead of the player so that the player couldn't run in front and interrupt animation\n\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/handmadecon-2015/","title":"HandmadeCon 2015"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/helping-out-with-rust-errors/":{"body":"I recently did some work with Niko Matsakis on a new compiler error format. You can try them out\nby setting RUST_NEW_ERROR_FORMAT=true. While I put together a\nblog post talking about the design for the main blog, I also wanted to open it up for people to come\nhelp us move to the new errors. I've split up this post based on background for testers, doc\nwriters, first-time compiler hackers, and experienced compiler hackers.\nI'm good at testing!\nPerfect! We've love your help to come up with tests that show where an error message is confusing or\njust plain wrong. If you'd like a little help getting started, there are a bunch of unit tests for\nthe compiler that all fail intentionally.  You can find these in the rust-lang repo under the\nsrc/test/compile_fail directory. You'll notice we've already started a\nlist of errors, but that list is incomplete. We'd\nlike to make sure every error code that needs to be updated makes it onto that list so that others\ncan help update them.\nThere are a bunch of good examples in the compile_fail directory that explore various error\ncodes. If you look around there\nyou can also search for error messages and see if there is already a test. Running this test will\nhelp you see if the error has been updated to the new format.\nIf you can find a test case that needs to be updated, file an issue like one of those listed in the\n\"list of errors\" link and cc @jntrnr. I can help get the error updated to the new format\nand tag the error so that others can find it.\nI love writing docs!\nGood, we need that too. There are a couple places where doc writers can help out, especially if\nif you already know a little Rust.\nThe first place is helping us write clearer error messages. Even now, and especailly as we move to\nthe new format, some errors are confusing and sometimes wrong. By helping write clearer error\nwording, and by experimenting with new ways to describe the error that is occuring, you can help us\nfurther improve the errors for the next developer.\nIf you look at the list of errors we have so far\nyou can see what we're going for. The likely need here is that errors need new labels. The general\nstyle of the new errors:\n\nThe error message text. This describes the general problem.\nThe primary error label (the '^^^' underline). This describes the 'what' of the error.\nIt tries to summarize what went wrong in an fairly brief, yet approachable way.\nThe secondary error label (the '+++' underline). This describes the 'why' of the error. By reading\nthese the user can see the order of operations that lead to the error.\n\nYou can also explore the src/test/compile-fail of the compiler source code for a lot of unit\ntests that fail intentionally.  By looking through these, you can help find errors that aren't\nupdate or that use confusing notes and labels.\nWorth mentioning too, if you're a writer, also keep a lookout for Stage 2 (which hopefully will be\nready in the coming weeks).  We'll need help in the future writing helpful extended messages that\ndescribe errors. A great place to jump into help out here and learn about other places doc writers\ncan help is #rust-docs on irc.mozilla.org.\nI know Rust but I've never hacked the compiler!\nExcellent, a first-time compiler hacker. Let's walk through updating an error\nmessage to the new format. You can look through the\nlist of errors to see which ones need updating.\nOnce you've downloaded the Rust compiler source, run the\ncommand:\n&gt; python src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py --step libstd --stage 1\nThis will build \"Stage 1\" of the compiler. After the first compile, this saves us a bunch of time\nas we test our ideas as it is the minimal compiler rather than a full install.\nOnce built, we can run this by hand using (here, I'm on OS X):\nRUST_NEW_ERROR_FORMAT=true ./build/x86_64-apple-darwin/stage1/bin/rustc &lt;rust file&gt;\nLet's take a look at an error that needs to be updated. You can find a lot of error tests in the\nsrc/test/compile-fail directory in the compiler source. For this example, I'll use\nsrc/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs. You can also see which\nerror this is looking for the EXXXX number, which is the error number.  This one is E0384.\nerror[E0384]: re-assignment of immutable variable `x`\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:50:13\n   |\n50 |             x += 1;\n   |             ^^^^^^\n   |\nnote: prior assignment occurs here\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:49:10\n   |\n49 |         [x,_,_] =&gt; {\n   |          ^\n\nWe can see that's still using some of the old logic because the underlines don't have a label. You\ncan also tell because there's an attached note is simple enough to be that label. Let's change\nthe note to be a label.\nTo fix this, we first need to find it in the compiler source. Search tools to the rescue. I tend to\nuse the error number (and sometimes part of the error message text)\njturner-23759:rust jturner$ grep -r E0384 src\nsrc/librustc_borrowck/borrowck/mod.rs:            self.tcx.sess, span, E0384,\nsrc/librustc_borrowck/diagnostics.rs:E0384: r##\"\n\nWe now have the line that creates the error and another that lists it for us. We only need to change\nthe first of these.\nLooking at the code, sure enough, this is using the older style:\nstruct_span_err!(\n    self.tcx.sess, span, E0384,\n    \"re-assignment of immutable variable `{}`\",\n    self.loan_path_to_string(lp))\n    .span_note(assign.span, \"prior assignment occurs here\")\n    .emit();\n\nThis is a pretty easy fix. We just move from .span_note to .span_label and create a simple\nlabel, like this:\nstruct_span_err!(\n    self.tcx.sess, span, E0384,\n    \"re-assignment of immutable variable `{}`\",\n    self.loan_path_to_string(lp))\n    .span_label(assign.span, &amp;format!(\"prior assignment occurs here\"))\n    .emit();\n\nOnce we build and run the new compiler against the error message, we get something where the label\nis now part of the main snippet.\nerror[E0384]: re-assignment of immutable variable `x`\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:50:13\n   |\n49 |         [x,_,_] =&gt; {\n   |          - prior assignment occurs here\n50 |             x += 1;\n   |             ^^^^^^\n\nThat looks a little better, but we're not done. You'll notice that we don't have a label on our\nprimary span (the ^^^^ part). In the new format, we like to have a label here because it's one of\nthe first places your eye will look when you see an error message.\nThe second is that the label \"prior assignment occurs here\". That feels a little awkward. Since the\nlabel is now part of our code snippet, we can use a better wording. Let's update the error to look\nlike this:\nerror[E0384]: re-assignment of immutable variable `x`\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:50:13\n   |\n49 |         [x,_,_] =&gt; {\n   |          - first assignment to `x`\n50 |             x += 1;\n   |             ^^^^^^ re-assignment of immutable variable\n\nWith a little bit of wording changes and the new primary label, that's not bad. Of course, as you\nget comfortable working with these errors you may find even better wording that's more clear. Next,\nlet's update the code to output this style:\nstruct_span_err!(\n    self.tcx.sess, span, E0384,\n    \"re-assignment of immutable variable `{}`\",\n    self.loan_path_to_string(lp))\n    .span_label(assign.span, &amp;format!(\"first assignment to `{}`\",\n                                      self.loan_path_to_string(lp)))\n    .span_label(span, &amp;format!(\"re-assignment of immutable variable\"))\n    .emit();\n\nYou'll notice that I reused the same span that the main error message uses in my new\n.span_label. When I do this, I'm telling the DiagnosticBuilder that this span_label is talking\nabout the primary span and is the root of what is causing the error. Other labels are secondary\nspans because they're more informational.\nAnd with that, we're done! Well, almost. We can't forget to update the unit tests.\nTo quickly check the unit tests that will fail because of our changes, we can run:\npython src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py --step check-cfail --stage 1\nCompile-fail unit tests are set up with their own annotations that say what labels to expect and\nwhere. As we update errors, we'll need to also update the corresponding test the new expected\nlabels.\nfailures:\n    [compile-fail] compile-fail/asm-out-assign-imm.rs\n    [compile-fail] compile-fail/assign-imm-local-twice.rs\n    [compile-fail] compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-insert-during-each.rs\n    [compile-fail] compile-fail/liveness-assign-imm-local-in-loop.rs\n    [compile-fail] compile-fail/liveness-assign-imm-local-in-op-eq.rs\n    [compile-fail] compile-fail/liveness-assign-imm-local-with-init.rs\n\ntest result: FAILED. 2381 passed; 6 failed; 15 ignored; 0 measured\n\nSure enough, we need to update some of the unit tests. Let's run these individually. To do this, we\ncan use:\npython src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py --step check-cfail &lt;test name&gt; --stage 1\nlike so:\npython src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py --step check-cfail asm-out-assign-imm --stage 1\nA fair amount of text comes out, but what we're interested in is:\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/asm-out-assign-imm.rs:21: unexpected \"note\": 'first assignment to `x`'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/asm-out-assign-imm.rs:24: unexpected \"note\": 're-assignment of immutable variable'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/asm-out-assign-imm.rs:21: expected note not found: prior assignment occurs here\n\nThese lines tell us what's breaking our test case. In this example we see there are notes being\nprinted that it doesn't expect and one expected note not found. This makes sense, since we changed\nthe wording in the error. Let's go ahead and fix this.\nWe can change:\n    x = 1; //~ NOTE prior assignment occurs here\n\nTo:\n    x = 1; //~ NOTE first assignment\n\nThe //~ tells the test runner what the expected message is. Here, the message is a NOTE, which\ncorresponds to the label we changed.\nOne more to go. We also added a new label on the primary span. We can insert a new note where\nthis goes:\n    unsafe {\n        asm!(\"mov $1, $0\" : \"=r\"(x) : \"r\"(5));\n        //~^ ERROR re-assignment of immutable variable `x`\n        //~| NOTE re-assignment of immutable\n        //~| NOTE in this expansion of asm!\n    }\n\nNotice: we use the //~ when the note is by itself, or //~^ and //~| when we're looking\nfor multiple notes.\nWith that, the test now passes:\nrunning 1 test\ntest [compile-fail] compile-fail/asm-out-assign-imm.rs ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured\n\nFrom there we work our way through the errors. Having these error tests failing gives us a chance\nto be sure that our fix is good. Here, when we fix\ncompile-fail/liveness-assign-imm-local-in-loop.rs we see that in a loop the two spans we're using\nmight be the same span if the error happens in a loop. Let's fix that:\nlet mut err = struct_span_err!(\n        self.tcx.sess, span, E0384,\n        \"re-assignment of immutable variable `{}`\",\n        self.loan_path_to_string(lp));\nerr.span_label(span, &amp;format!(\"re-assignment of immutable variable\"));\nif span != assign.span {\n    err.span_label(assign.span, &amp;format!(\"first assignment to `{}`\",\n                                         self.loan_path_to_string(lp)));\n}\nerr.emit();\n\nWhile we're at it, let's run a quick tidy to make sure our code conforms to the compiler coding\nstandard:\npython src/bootstrap/bootstrap.py --stage 1 --step check-tidy\nPerfect.  Ship it!\nAfter we've finished with updating the error and the corresponding unit tests, we can create a PR.\nWhen you file the PR, put the message \"r? @jntrnr\" at the bottom of your commit\nmessage. This will add me to do the code review.\nExtra credit\nA keen eye will notice that the file we've been working on did not show up in our failed tests.\n\"Why is that?\" you might ask. Unit tests that look at the compiler messages work in a few different\nways. Some look at how a test looks (eg, tests in the src/test/ui directory). Others make sure the\ncontent is there, like the unit tests we just fixed. Because there is a lot of content to look for\nthere are two kinds of \"look for content\" error test cases. The first kind will only look at the\nmain message. You can see that this is the case because these test cases have no indicators to look\nfor NOTE or HELP, only ERROR and WARN.\nWatch what happens if we add a single NOTE to our original test case:\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:25: unexpected \"note\": 'first assignment to `x`'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:32: unexpected \"note\": 'first assignment to `x`'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:33: unexpected \"note\": 're-assignment of immutable variable'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:38: unexpected \"note\": 'first assignment to `x`'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:39: unexpected \"note\": 're-assignment of immutable variable'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:44: unexpected \"note\": 'first assignment to `x`'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:45: unexpected \"note\": 're-assignment of immutable variable'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:50: unexpected \"note\": 'first assignment to `x`'\n\nerror: /Users/jturner/Source/rust/src/test/compile-fail/borrowck/borrowck-match-binding-is-assignment.rs:51: unexpected \"note\": 're-assignment of immutable variable'\n\nThat's more like it! Now, we can continue fixing this unit test like we did the others.\nTips\nAs you convert errors you may need to change span_err (or span_err!)\nto struct_span_err (or struct_span_err!), add new .span_labels, or tweak the wording for the\nerror message to feel right.\nI'm an experienced Rust compiler hacker!\nPerfect! There are a few hairy things we need to figure out, still, and they may require the keen\neye of a compiler hacker. In the list of errors\nthere is a second list of issues for experienced compiler hackers. Additionally, there are areas\nthat need a bit more work to make them feel like the new messages.\nRegion errors\nRegions errors currently provide a decent amount of information, but unfortunately to understand it\nyou currently need a pretty decent understanding of Rust already. Ideally, these messages would get\na similar treatment to the borrowck errors mentioned above.\nSomething like:\nerror[E0495]: cannot infer an appropriate lifetime for lifetime parameter 'r in function call due to conflicting requirements\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/regions-infer-call-3.rs:18:24\n   |\n18 |     let z = with(|y| { select(x, y) });\n   |                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   |\nnote: first, the lifetime cannot outlive the anonymous lifetime #1 defined on the block at 18:21...\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/regions-infer-call-3.rs:18:22\n   |\n18 |     let z = with(|y| { select(x, y) });\n   |                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nnote: ...so that reference does not outlive borrowed content\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/regions-infer-call-3.rs:18:34\n   |\n18 |     let z = with(|y| { select(x, y) });\n   |                                  ^\nnote: but, the lifetime must be valid for the call at 18:12...\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/regions-infer-call-3.rs:18:13\n   |\n18 |     let z = with(|y| { select(x, y) });\n   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nnote: ...so type `&amp;isize` of expression is valid during the expression\n  --&gt; src/test/compile-fail/regions-infer-call-3.rs:18:13\n   |\n18 |     let z = with(|y| { select(x, y) });\n   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYou can see that we say things like \"for the call at 18:12\" or \"on the block at 18:21\". The span\ninformation is available but we're not really using it well. Instead of saying this, we may want to\ncalculate the actual span that relates to \"the call at 18:12\" or the end point of \"the block at\n18:21\".\nMacro errors\nI've started a thread on\nimproving macro errors on the Rust\ninternals list. The hope is to look at a better overall design for macro errors that fits better\nwith the new error style.\nThanks!\nThanks for wanting to jump in and help! You can find me on irc.mozilla.org as jntrnr and on\ngithub.com as jntrnr. If you have any questions, please ask. You can also get lots of good\nhelp in #rust-internals and #rustc on irc.mozilla.org.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/helping-out-with-rust-errors/","title":"Helping with the Rust Errors"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/how-fast-can-we-compile-rust-hello-world/":{"body":"Seeing Nick Nethercote's blog post about speeding up the compiler, I started wondering just how fast could a Rust compiler be?  How fast could we compile a simple example?  How fast can we compile a Rust hello world?\nStarting out\nWhen you do a cargo new hello_rust --bin, you get a simple Rust hello world:\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nAwesome.  Let's see how long this takes to build:\n&gt; time cargo build\n   Compiling hello_rust v0.1.0 (file:///home/jonathan/Source/hello_rust)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52 secs\n\nreal     0m0.548s\nuser     0m0.468s\nsys      0m0.080s\n\nHalf a second on my XPS 13 9360, with a i7-7500U @ 2.70GHz with 16 gigs of RAM.  That seems, a bit long for a hello world.  Maybe cargo is doing extra work?\n&gt; time rustc src/main.rs\n\nreal     0m0.378s\nuser     0m0.289s\nsys      0m0.083s\n\nThat's definitely better.  We're just over 1/3rd of a second.\nWhat should we expect?  If only there were another language we could compile a hello world for that's comparable... \n&gt; cat hello_c.c\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    puts(\"Hello, from C!\");\n    return 0;\n}\n&gt; time clang hello_c.c\n\nreal     0m0.082s\nuser     0m0.021s\nsys      0m0.041s\n\nWoooaah!  Wait a second.  You're telling me that compiling C hello world is over 4.5x faster.  That's... that's something.  Maybe the compiler is doing a bit too much work for this small example?  I mean, we don't need much from the standard library, just the println macro.\nYou know, a reasonable person would probably stop here and walk away.  Chalk it up to \"Rust is more complicated\" or \"maybe if I knew the right commandline options\"\nNo, that's not us.  Not today.  Today, we're going to write our own Rust translator.  We're going to see just how fast we can compile Rust to a working hello world.\nFirst stop: let's build a Rust-&gt;C translator.\nHere's my thinking: if we write our own translator, we can translate the Rust to C ourselves, and then compile the C.  That way, we should end up with a compile time close to the C.\n&gt; cargo new rabbithole --bin\n\nWriting a full compiler is complex work, but we're going for speed here.  And speed means cutting corners.  To that end, we're implementing just enough of a compiler to translate our Rust to C, then we're calling that good enough.\nFirst step, we need a parser.

The top-most thing is a File.\n\nFile\n\nEach File continues zero or more Items.  An Item are things like declarations.  Function declarations, for example, are one kind of Item.\n\nFile\n\nItem\n\n\n\nSince this file has one function, it has one item, an ItemFn.  This holds all the information about our main function.  You can see in here that we have the function's declaration (sometimes called the function prototype, if you come from C).  This tells us how many parameters it takes, what its return type is, etc.  Luckily for us, this is all empty because main has nothing interesting here.  This lets us focus on the body of the function, here called 'block'\n\nFile\n\nItem (ItemFn)\n\nBlock\n\n\n\n\n\nBlocks contain statements and expressions.  This is really the meat of what actually does things, and which is where we'll actually spend our time writing the compiler.  Let's take a closer look:\nblock: Block {\n    brace_token: Brace,\n    stmts: [\n        Item(\n            Macro(\n                ItemMacro {\n                    attrs: [],\n                    ident: None,\n                    mac: Macro {\n                        path: Path {\n                            leading_colon: None,\n                            segments: [\n                                PathSegment {\n                                    ident: Ident {\n                                        term: Term {\n                                            sym: println\n                                        }\n                                    },\n                                    arguments: None\n                                }\n                            ]\n                        },\n                        bang_token: Bang,\n                        delimiter: Paren(\n                            Paren\n                        ),\n                        tts: TokenStream [\n                            Literal {\n                                lit: \"Hello, world!\"\n                            }\n                        ]\n                    },\n                    semi_token: Some(\n                        Semi\n                    )\n                }\n            )\n        )\n    ]\n}\n\nOn closer inspection we see this block has only one statement.  A something-something macro something or other.  Oh right, println is a macro!  Let's focus on just the macro invocation itself:\nmac: Macro {\n    path: Path {\n        leading_colon: None,\n        segments: [\n            PathSegment {\n                ident: Ident {\n                    term: Term {\n                        sym: println\n                    }\n                },\n                arguments: None\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    bang_token: Bang,\n    delimiter: Paren(\n        Paren\n    ),\n    tts: TokenStream [\n        Literal {\n            lit: \"Hello, world!\"\n        }\n    ]\n},\n\nNow this is a little more like it.  It's still a little cumbersome, but we can see the parts we need.  There's a sym thing that says what the macro is.  Later on, we can see the string that we're printing is a literal string.  We can ignore the rest.\nThat's it.  Make sure it's invoking println, and then we'll look for the string that's being printed.\nTo make things a little easier on ourselves, let's make a quick-and-dirty intermediate representation.  This will only have one command so far, but it'll be an easy way to de-couple the function that does the parsing from the one that does the code generation.\nenum Command {\n    PrintLn(String)\n}\n\nWith that, we're ready to make our parser that can take in the syn::File and output our Command.  There are a few ways we can do this, but to keep things pretty simple, I'm going to make a separate parse function for each layer we talked about earlier: File, Item, and Block.  You can think of this as us unpacking the useful information from what syn gives us into much simpler data structures.\nextern crate syn;\n\nuse std::env;\nuse std::fs;\nuse std::io::Read;\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct File {\n    functions: Vec&lt;Function&gt;,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Function {\n    body: Vec&lt;Command&gt;,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\nenum Command {\n    PrintLn(String),\n}\n\nfn parse_body(body: &amp;syn::Block) -&gt; Result&lt;Vec&lt;Command&gt;, String&gt; {\n    let mut stmts = vec![];\n    for stmt in &amp;body.stmts {\n        match stmt {\n            syn::Stmt::Item(syn::Item::Macro(ref im)) =&gt; {\n                let macro_name = im.mac.path.segments[0].ident.as_ref();\n                if macro_name == \"println\" {\n                    match im.mac.tts.clone().into_iter().next() {\n                        Some(ref arg) =&gt; {\n                            stmts.push(Command::PrintLn(arg.to_string()));\n                        }\n                        None =&gt; return Err(\"Expected argument in function\".into()),\n                    }\n                } else {\n                    return Err(format!(\"Unknown macro: {}\", macro_name));\n                }\n            }\n            _ =&gt; return Err(\"Unexpected statement in function\".into()),\n        }\n    }\n    Ok(stmts)\n}\n\nfn parse_fn(item: &amp;syn::ItemFn) -&gt; Result&lt;Function, String&gt; {\n    Ok(Function {\n        body: parse_body(&amp;item.block)?,\n    })\n}\n\nfn parse_file(file: &amp;syn::File) -&gt; Result&lt;File, String&gt; {\n    let mut functions = vec![];\n    for item in &amp;file.items {\n        match item {\n            syn::Item::Fn(ref item_fn) =&gt; {\n                functions.push(parse_fn(item_fn)?);\n            }\n            _ =&gt; return Err(\"Unexpected item in file\".into()),\n        }\n    }\n    Ok(File { functions })\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut args = env::args();\n    args.next();\n\n    match args.next() {\n        Some(fname) =&gt; {\n            let mut src = String::new();\n            let mut file = fs::File::open(&amp;fname).expect(\"Unable to open file\");\n            file.read_to_string(&amp;mut src).expect(\"Unable to read file\");\n\n            let syntax = syn::parse_file(&amp;src).expect(\"Unable to parse file\");\n            let result = parse_file(&amp;syntax);\n\n            println!(\"{:#?}\", result);\n        }\n        _ =&gt; {\n            println!(\"Please supply the file to compile\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWhich results in:\nOk(\n    File {\n        functions: [\n            Function {\n                body: [\n                    PrintLn(\n                        \"\\\"Hello, world!\\\"\"\n                    )\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n)\n\nThat's much nicer!  It took a little work reading the syn documentation, but once we got the hang of it, we can now work with real Rust source code and turn it into something we can use.\nOh, before we go, let's clean one thing up.  You might have noticed that extra set of quotes in the macro argument.  No problem, we'll just turn:\nstmts.push(Command::PrintLn(arg.to_string()));\n\nInto:\nstmts.push(Command::PrintLn(arg.to_string().replace(\"\\\"\", \"\")));\n\nWhich gives us:\nOk(\n    File {\n        functions: [\n            Function {\n                body: [\n                    PrintLn(\n                        \"Hello, world!\"\n                    )\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n)\n\nBeautiful.  Now that we have it in this form, we have a much simpler form that we can hand to the other half of the translator.  In this half, we'll be outputting the C code and compiling it.\nSince we only care about one function in one file, let's just make a quick-and-dirty function to generate the C:\nfn compile_to_c(file: &amp;File) -&gt; String {\n    let mut c_output = String::new();\n\n    c_output += \"#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\\n\";\n    c_output += \"int main() {\\n\";\n\n    for stmt in &amp;file.functions[0].body {\n        match stmt {\n            Command::PrintLn(ref msg) =&gt; {\n                c_output += &amp;format!(\"puts(\\\"{}\\\");\\n\", msg);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    c_output += \"}\\n\";\n    c_output\n}\n\nThat's it.  Let's call it.\nprintln!(\"{}\", compile_to_c(&amp;result.unwrap()));\n\nRunning it again, we get:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main() {\nputs(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nWoah!  That looks like C to me.  Dare we try to compile it?\n&gt; cargo run -- ../hello_rust/src/main.rs  &gt; testme.c\n&gt; clang testme.c\n&gt; ./a.out\nHello, world!\n\nIt... works!  We just made a compiler!\n&gt; time ./target/release/rabbithole ../hello_rust/src/main.rs &gt; testme.c\n\nreal    0m0.014s\nuser    0m0.010s\nsys    0m0.004s\n&gt; time clang testme.c -o testme\nreal    0m0.100s\nuser    0m0.043s\nsys    0m0.041s\n\nNice, by cutting lots of corners and making our own translator, we got the compile times down from 0.378s to 0.114s, less than 1/3rd of where we were.\nShould we stop there?  Surely we can go further down the rabbit hole.  Oh right, C is not the lowest we can go\nDeeper down the rabbit hole\nLet's cook up some assembly.  First, let's test how fast we can assemble a hello world in assembly.\n&gt; cat hello_asm.s\n .text\n .global main\nmain:\n mov $hw_str, %rdi\n call puts\n mov $0, %rax\n ret\n\n .data\nhw_str:\n .asciz \"hello asm\"\n&gt; time as hello_asm.s -o hello_asm.o\nreal    0m0.019s\nuser    0m0.008s\nsys    0m0.011s\n&gt; time ld -o hello -dynamic-linker /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crt1.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crti.o -lc hello_asm.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crtn.o\n\nreal    0m0.044s\nuser    0m0.036s\nsys    0m0.008s\n\nWow, the assembly output cuts the compile almost in half!  If you haven't seen x64 assembly before, that might look a little strange.  Instead of working with C code with functions, we've dropped down much closer to the machine itself.  The above represents the lowest we can go in Linux.  Let's unpack what's happening:\n .text\n .global main\n\nOur assembly file starts with two things.  One, a section that we'll be talking about the code itself (.text) and then the one symbol we'll be making visible (main).  This will be the main function that the linker will use later.\nNext, main begins:\nmain:\n\nWhat follows are series of assembly commands.  The hardware keeps numbers and addresses in registers, similar to how you might store them in variables.\nmov $hw_str, %rdi\ncall puts\n\nWith that in mind, this doesn't seem quite so bad.  The first line is going to set up our register that we'll use as the argument to the puts function (here, in Linux, %rdi).  After the argument is ready, we call puts.\n mov $0, %rax\n ret\n\nAfter that, we return 0, just like we did in C.  Here, in 64-bit assembly, we're returning the return value in %rax.\nThat's it.  Oh wait, one more thing.  So this was the code section, we still haven't told it what the string is to print (which we called $hw_str earlier).\n .data\nhw_str:\n .asciz \"hello asm\"\n\nThat's not bad.  We have a data section that contains our strings.  We have one string, called hw_str, and we give it a null-terminated string to print.\nYou may have been wondering about our linker line, too:\n&gt; time ld -o hello -dynamic-linker /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crt1.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crti.o -lc hello_asm.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crtn.o\n\nThis bit of magic is actually the kind of tasks that your C compiler does for you behind the scenes.  In Linux, for a program to run, it needs to be able to access things like the Linux program loader, the C standard library, and the Linux subsystems.  The above takes the barebones object file we made with the assembler and gives it all it needs to be a complete Linux executable.\nBefore we write our assembly-outputting function, let's take a quick pause and talk about Windows.  We've been giving a lot of examples for Linux, but you can do the same kinds of things in Windows.  Make sure you have a 64-bit nasm installed.\nC:\\Users\\Jonathan\\source\\fast_hello&gt;type nasm_hello.asm\n    global main\n    extern puts\n\n    section .text\nmain:\n    push rbp\n    mov rbp, rsp\n    mov rcx, message\n    call puts\n    mov rax, 0\n    pop rbp\n    ret\nmessage:\n    db 'Hello, Rust!', 0\nC:\\Users\\Jonathan\\source\\fast_hello&gt;nasm -f win64 nasm_hello.asm -g -o nasm_hello.obj\n\nC:\\Users\\Jonathan\\source\\fast_hello&gt;link -out:b.exe -defaultlib:libcmt \"-libpath:C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\\\VC\\\\lib\\\\amd64\" \"-libpath:C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\10\\\\Lib\\\\10.0.15063.0\\\\ucrt\\\\x64\" \"-libpath:C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\10\\\\Lib\\\\10.0.15063.0\\\\um\\\\x64\" -nologo nasm_hello.obj\n\nYou can see that the assembly looks different, though it's similar.  We do a little more setup, but the core of the work is the same.  We set up where the string is, we send it to the puts function, and we return 0 via the rax register.  Likewise, after we have an object file from the assembler, we have to do a similar dance with the linker in order to have a fully working Windows executable.\nWith that, we can see all the techniques we're using in Linux can work in Windows, too.\nOkay, let's finish this up and see where we are.  Just like we wrote a C output function, we're going to write an assembly output function.  This function will create two strings: one for the code and one for the data, and then stitch them together.\nfn compile_to_asm(file: &amp;File) -&gt; String {\n    let mut asm_code_output = String::new();\n    let mut asm_data_output = String::new();\n\n    asm_data_output += \".data\\n\";\n\n    asm_code_output += \".text\\n\";\n    asm_code_output += \".global main\\n\";\n    asm_code_output += \"main:\\n\";\n\n    let mut temp_num = 0;\n    for stmt in &amp;file.functions[0].body {\n        match stmt {\n            Command::PrintLn(ref msg) =&gt; {\n                asm_code_output += &amp;format!(\"mov $str_{}, %edi\\n\", temp_num);\n                asm_code_output += \"call puts\\n\";\n\n                asm_data_output += &amp;format!(\"str_{}:\\n\", temp_num);\n                asm_data_output += &amp;format!(\" .asciz \\\"{}\\\"\", msg);\n                temp_num += 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    asm_code_output + &amp;asm_data_output\n}\n&gt; time ./target/release/rabbithole ../hello_rust/src/main.rs &gt; hello_asm.s\n\nreal    0m0.015s\nuser    0m0.010s\nsys    0m0.005s\n&gt; time as hello_asm.s -o hello_asm.o\nreal    0m0.022s\nuser    0m0.009s\nsys    0m0.012s\n&gt; time ld -o hello -dynamic-linker /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crt1.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crti.o -lc hello_asm.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crtn.o\n\nreal    0m0.043s\nuser    0m0.029s\nsys    0m0.011s\n\nFrom 0.114s to 0.08s.  We dropped another 30% off the compile time!\nTo recap, we started at 0.548s with Cargo, then 0.378s with rustc, 0.114 going via C, and 0.08 going via assembly.  Roughly a 6.8x speedup.  Can we squeeze anything else out?\nYou might be wondering about keeping more things in memory and getting a bit more caching.  It's a good hunch, let's try it!\n&gt; time (./target/release/rabbithole ../hello_rust/src/main.rs &gt; hello_asm.s &amp;&amp; as hello_asm.s -o hello_asm.o &amp;&amp; ld -o hello -dynamic-linker /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crt1.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crti.o -lc hello_asm.o /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/crtn.o)\n\nreal    0m0.048s\nuser    0m0.028s\nsys    0m0.021s\n\nThat's another 40% off the compile time.  We've now gone from 0.548s to 0.048s, a whole 11x faster.  There's even more we can do.  For example, we can squeeze out more by writing our own parser, outputting the .o ourselves, and more.  But we'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.\nConclusion\nI hope you had as much fun reading this post as I had in writing it.  There are amazing benefits to all the features that cargo and rustc provide, and the Rust ecosystem builds on those benefits.  At the same time, it's fun to play around with compiler technology and see that when we get down to it, it's just another Rust program that we can tune to our heart's content.\nYou can see the rabbithole source if you want to play with it yourself.  \n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/how-fast-can-we-compile-rust-hello-world/","title":"How fast can we compile Rust hello world?"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/how-we-talk-about-rust-in-2018/":{"body":"This is an entry in the #rust2018 blogging efforts to talk about Rust in 2018\nWhen you come to Rust, you're bound to hear a lot of phrases.  \"Wrestling with the compiler\". \"Rust evangelism task force\". \"Non-lexical lifetimes\". \"Systems programming\".  Some seem strange. Others are a bit scary.  Some are just a common set you quickly need to learn to before you can even read the Rust news.\nIn this post, I want to talk about how we talk about Rust in 2018.  I think there are some ways we can change what we're saying and how we're saying it. These changes will help Rust be more approachable for beginners and an even nicer place in general.\n\"Wrestling with the compiler\"\nI think we've all been there. Especially when we're starting with Rust, or trying to do something new with it we haven't done before, we feel like the compiler is fighting us every step of the way.\nSure, it's frustrating. On a bad day, we might even say \"forget it\". I wonder, though, is there a better way to talk about it? If you're a Rust user, do you trust the compiler?  Are the error messages helping to clarify your thinking?  Is it, as some people like to say, a pair programming partner for you?\nI suggest in 2018, we kick the idea of wrestling with the Rust compiler to the curb and focus on how it helps us rather than the idea of it beating us down.  Niko mentioned error messages here to help with that, and I think we should push hard there.  While we can change how we talk about the compiler, we can also change how the compiler talks to us as well.\nBy the end of 2018, no more wrestling.  It's a tool to help us, and we should work hard both in how we talk and how it works to ensure this is true.\n\"Rust evangelism task force\"\nWe've seen the jokes about Rust having its own task force that swoops in and says things like \"you should rewrite it in Rust\".  Sometimes the swoop happens just as a new security exploit is released.  Sometimes it comes out of nowhere.\nOr maybe you've seen this: someone on a thread, maybe on reddit, posts that maybe Rust isn't doing so well in a benchmark or in a particular scenario.  Minutes later there are half a dozen comments dissecting what happened.\nIt's intimidating.  And really, it's not helpful to Rust.\nAs a community, it's great that we have so much enthusiasm.  I just want to be sure we're channeling that enthusiasm in a way that keeps Rust growing.  There are ways we can be courteous by not piling on or jumping in with uninvited suggestions.  That might seem like little things, but at scale I think they'll make a big difference.\nSome of you may be familiar with burntsushi's ripgrep tool.  The author of a similar tool, ack, had a great quote about the other day that applies to more than just search tools:\n\n\"If someone uses ripgrep instead of ack, it doesn’t hurt me.  It’s the difference between an abundance vs. scarcity view of the world.  I choose abundance.\"\n\nWe can adopt the same way of thinking.  If someone wants to use Go or C instead of Rust, that's great!  Perhaps that's a better fit for what they're working on.  Maybe they'll try Rust again in the future.  We should make it easy to come and go.\n\"Systems programming\"\nThere are a lot of terms that we use when talking about Rust that I think are simply confusing.  Have you ever had this conversation?\nPerson 1: Have you heard of the Rust programming language?\nPerson 2: I'm not sure, what is it?\nPerson 1: It's a systems programming language.\nPerson 2: What's a systems programming language?\nRather than answering the question, we just made it seem even more complicated.  Confusingly, even among people who have used Rust for a while there isn't even total consensus on what is meant by a systems programming language.  Doubly confusingly, Rust isn't even just a systems programming language anymore.  With the ability to create web applications and tie into other languages, it starts to feel more than just systems-level development.\nYou can use Rust to build pretty much anything from a low-level operating system component to a JSX-like web app.  In the future, we'll be in space.  Systems is both too confusing and too limiting for what Rust will be used to do.\nMaybe there's a better term that we can use, or a small phrase that captures the right feel?\n\"Non-lexical lifetimes\" and more\nLots of the Rust community is pretty facile when it comes to computer science.  Some of us have dabbled in Haskell.  Others are old-hands at C++.  We've seen programming from different angles and have a lot of vocabulary to use to describe Rust.\nThis started out as pretty effective short-hand.  \"This is like typeclasses in Haskell\" we might say.  \"Lifetimes are lexically-scoped\".  \"You need to use a lifetime variable, they're just like generics...\" Etc.  We can use it to communicate, but the end result can be a bit of a mouthful.\nI'm not going to suggest we remove these terms from our vocabulary entirely, but I want us to think about how we can improve what we write publically.  People we don't know will come by IRC, read our blog posts, and see our forum threads.  They'll be coming from a variety of backgrounds, many of which will be different from our own.\nIf where we're talking is public with a wide audience, let's keep that in mind as we communicate.  Keep the door open for more people to join.\nRust, at its heart, isn't intimidating.  It's a technology that a wide range of programmers can use to target a wide range of applications.  We don't need to make it sound or feel more complicated, and those extra few minutes to reword a sentence here or there can help.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/how-we-talk-about-rust-in-2018/","title":"Talking about how we talk about Rust in 2018"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/intermedia-rust-series/":{"body":"Hi all!\nA few days ago I posted on Twitter asking for topics that people wanted to see covered for intermediate Rust content.

It draws inspiration from the classic Unix philosophy of pipelines, the structured data approach of PowerShell, functional programming, systems programming, and more.\nIt's called Nushell, or just Nu for short.  We have a book (¡también se habla Español!). We have a repo. \nThis release was made by Jonathan Turner (me), Yehuda Katz, and Andrés Robalino, with contributions from Odin Dutton.\n\nBut why?\nMany of us have gotten used to bash (or zsh/fish/etc), and don't understand why you would need another kind of shell. That was me, too, a few months ago before I started working on this. My friend Yehuda had discovered PowerShell and was going on and on about how amazing it was to do more with the shell, but until he actually gave me a demo, I didn't really believe him.\nThen he talked me into joining him on an idea he had. What if we could take the ideas of a structured shell and make it more functional (as opposed to object-oriented)? What if, like PowerShell, it worked on Windows, Linux, and macOS? What if it had great error messages? I fell in love with the project ideas, made a few new friends, and many nights and weekends later I'd like to show you what we've made.\nIn this post, I'll talk about how a few simple ideas drive how Nu works, what Nu can do with them, and where we hope to go in the future.\nSimple ideas\nTo Nu, everything is data.  When you type ls, you're given a table of information about the directory you're listing:\n\nRather than having to remember different flags to ls, we can just work with the data it gives back. We can find the files greater than a certain size:\n\nOr we could choose to sort it by a column, or only show directories, or more. That by itself is fun but perhaps not compelling enough.\n\nWhere this simple concept - that everything in Nu is data - starts to shine when we try other commands and realize that we're using the same commands to filter, to sort, etc. Rather than having the need to remember all the parameters to all the commands, we can just use the same verbs to act over our data, regardless of where the data came from.  Nu pushes this idea even further.\n\nNu also understands structured text files like JSON, TOML, YAML, and more. Opening these files gives us the same tables we saw with ls and ps. Again, this lets us use the same commands to filter our data, explore it, and use it.\nWorking with the outside world\nThe above approach could be fun, but if we're not careful, it could become a walled garden. What happens outside of the commands Nu comes with?\nFirst, let's take a look at working with a file that Nu doesn't understand.\n&gt; open people.psv\nOctavia | Butler | Writer\nBob | Ross | Painter\nAntonio | Vivaldi | Composer\n\nTo work with this in Nu, we need to do two steps: figure out where the rows are, and then figure out what the columns are. The rows are pretty easy, we just have one record per row:\n&gt; open people.psv | lines\n---+------------------------------\n # | value \n---+------------------------------\n 0 | Octavia | Butler | Writer \n 1 | Bob | Ross | Painter \n 2 | Antonio | Vivaldi | Composer \n---+------------------------------\n\nNext, we can create our columns by splitting each row at the pipe (|) symbol:\n&gt; open people.psv | lines | split-column \"|\"\n---+----------+-----------+-----------\n # | Column1  | Column2   | Column3 \n---+----------+-----------+-----------\n 0 | Octavia  |  Butler   |  Writer \n 1 | Bob      |  Ross     |  Painter \n 2 | Antonio  |  Vivaldi  |  Composer \n---+----------+-----------+-----------\n\nThat's already good enough that we can work with the data.

You get used to using the verbs, and then you can use them on anything. When you're ready, you can write it back to disk.\nOh, before I forget - I wanted to quickly show how to get data from Nu back out into the outside world. Here's an example of calling echo on each filename in a directory:\n&gt; ls | get name | echo $it\n\nYou can see that we can mix-and-match commands that are inside of Nu with those that are outside, and data will still flow between them as expected. But Nu is more than just a pipeline.\nMore than a pipeline\nAs we built Nu, we realized we could experiment with other parts of how a shell works. The first of these experiments lead us to an observation: if everything is data in Nu, we should be able to view this data.\n\nWe've seen the tables. Nu also supports opening and looking at text and binary data. If we open a source file, we can scroll around in a syntax-highlighted file. If we open an xml, we can look at its data. We can even open a binary file and look at what's inside (hint: there's even a fun easter egg if you open certain kinds binary files, especially if you've installed Nu with the optional rawkey feature).\nBeing able to view data is helpful, and this kind of polish extends to other aspects, like error messages:\n\nNu takes heavy inspiration from the error messages in Rust. As much as possible, draw your eyes to the problem. \nCombined with the pipeline, some pretty interesting errors are possible:\n\nYou might wonder how does that even work. Nu has a metadata system (still early!) that you can read about in the Metadata chapter of the Nu book. Let's just take a quick peek at it:\n&gt; open Cargo.toml\n------------+--------------+------------------+----------+----------\n bin        | dependencies | dev-dependencies | lib      | package \n------------+--------------+------------------+----------+----------\n [11 items] | [object]     | [object]         | [object] | [object] \n------------+--------------+------------------+----------+----------\n&gt; open Cargo.toml | tags\n----------+------------------------------------------\n span     | origin \n----------+------------------------------------------\n [object] | /home/jonathan/Source/nushell/Cargo.toml \n----------+------------------------------------------\n\nData that flows through the pipeline gets a set of additional metadata tagged to it. We can use this later to figure out how to display the contents, show a better error message, and more.\nShells, plural\nLet's say you're in a directory, but you'd really like to flip back and forth between it and one or two others. You could open up multiple tabs, multiple terminals, if you're on a Unix system you could use \"screen\", and probably even more than that. What if the shells were just built in?\nIn Nu, we can enter a directory, which adds it to a ring of shells we can bounce between:\n&gt; enter ../rhai/\n/home/jonathan/Source/rhai(master)&gt; shells\n---+---+------------+-------------------------------\n # |   | name       | path \n---+---+------------+-------------------------------\n 0 |   | filesystem | /home/jonathan/Source/nushell \n 1 | X | filesystem | /home/jonathan/Source/rhai \n---+---+------------+-------------------------------\n\nUsing n and p we can jump back and forth between the shells. exit gets us out of a shell.\nYou might noticed that name column in the shells table. Why's that there?  Oh no... oh yes.\n&gt; enter Cargo.toml\n/&gt; shells\n---+---+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------------\n # |   | name                                       | path \n---+---+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------------\n 0 |   | filesystem                                 | /home/jonathan/Source/nushell \n 1 |   | filesystem                                 | /home/jonathan/Source/rhai \n 2 | X | {/home/jonathan/Source/nushell/Cargo.toml} | / \n---+---+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------------\n\nThat's right, we're in the file.  Can we cd? Oh yes, we can:\n/&gt; ls\n------------+--------------+------------------+----------+----------\n bin        | dependencies | dev-dependencies | lib      | package \n------------+--------------+------------------+----------+----------\n [11 items] | [object]     | [object]         | [object] | [object] \n------------+--------------+------------------+----------+----------\n/&gt; cd bin\n/bin&gt; ls\n----+----------------------+---------------------------\n #  | name                 | path \n----+----------------------+---------------------------\n 0  | nu_plugin_inc        | src/plugins/inc.rs \n 1  | nu_plugin_sum        | src/plugins/sum.rs \n 2  | nu_plugin_add        | src/plugins/add.rs \n 3  | nu_plugin_edit       | src/plugins/edit.rs \n 4  | nu_plugin_str        | src/plugins/str.rs \n 5  | nu_plugin_skip       | src/plugins/skip.rs \n 6  | nu_plugin_sys        | src/plugins/sys.rs \n 7  | nu_plugin_tree       | src/plugins/tree.rs \n 8  | nu_plugin_binaryview | src/plugins/binaryview.rs \n 9  | nu_plugin_textview   | src/plugins/textview.rs \n 10 | nu                   | src/main.rs \n----+----------------------+---------------------------\nPlugins\nNu can't come with everything you might want to do with it, so we're releasing Nu with the ability to extend it with plugins.  There's more information in the plugins chapters.  Nu will look for these plugins in your path, and load them up on startup.\nAll because of Rust\nNu would not have been possible without Rust. Internally, it uses async/await, async streams, and liberal use of \"serde\" to manage serializing and deserializing into the common data format and to communicate with plugins.\nWe also heavily leveraged crates.io. The ability to load numerous file formats, display messages, draw tables, and more all came from the hundreds (thousands?) of generous developers who wrote the crates we use in Nu. A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to Nu without ever knowing it.\nWhat's next?\nNu is just getting started. In this release, we have a foundation to build on. Next, we'll work towards stability, the abilty to use Nu as your main shell, the ability to write functions and scripts in Nu, and much more.\nIf you want to give it a spin, the installation instructions will help you get started.

Coming from C++, a fair share of the idioms felt right at home.  There was clear memory management and an eye towards lightweight abstractions.\nBut when I started looking around for how to do exceptions, I was surprised to find that Rust had none.  In its place were types like this:\nfn foo_maker() -&gt; Result&lt;Foo, io::Error&gt; { ...}\n\nI recognized this style, having come from playing with languages like Haskell, but despite doing some functional programming before I wasn't entirely sure how to approach it.  At first blush, the Result value seems pretty straightforward, it either returns something of Foo or an io::Error.  We know which one it returns by pattern matching out the value:\nlet result = foo_maker();\nmatch result {\n  Ok(foo) -&gt; foo,\n  Err(err) -&gt; println!(\"Error: {:?}\", err) // Ooops, we hit an error, tell the user\n}\n\nGreat, you might think, that's cute.  Well, at least at first.  Real code tends to have a few reads in a row:\nlet num_chans = read_u16_le(&amp;mut f);\nlet samples_per_sec = read_u32_le(&amp;mut f);\nlet avg_bytes_per_sec = read_u32_le(&amp;mut f);\nlet block_align = read_u16_le(&amp;mut f);\nlet bits_per_sample = read_u16_le(&amp;mut f);\n\nSince we're reading from a file, any of these reads could hit an error.  Perhaps the hard drive dies, or we prematurely hit the end of the file.  Because of that, each function returns a Result that we later have to pattern match to get the value out.  This means we have to pattern match every result.  Yuck.\nIf you poke around on the internets, you'll find a sneaky way around this using .unwrap().  The .unwrap() call does just what it name implies: it unwraps the Result and gives us the value, assuming the result is Ok.  What if it errored with an Err? Well, then the application panics.\nlet num_chans = read_u16_le(&amp;mut f).unwrap();\nlet samples_per_sec = read_u32_le(&amp;mut f).unwrap();\nlet avg_bytes_per_sec = read_u32_le(&amp;mut f).unwrap();\nlet block_align = read_u16_le(&amp;mut f).unwrap();\nlet bits_per_sample = read_u16_le(&amp;mut f).unwrap();\n\nIf you felt a cold shiver run down your spine looking at that, good on you :).  Now, let's talk about how we actually fix this code.\nDo or do not. There is a try!\nLooking a bit further in Rust examples, I learned about another way to call functions using the try! macro.  Maybe, I thought, try! would save us.  So I tried it out:\nuse std::io;\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut f = try!(File::open(\"foo.txt\"));\n}\n\n...and BOOM\n&lt;std macros&gt;:5:8: 6:42 error: mismatched types:\n expected `()`,\n    found `core::result::Result&lt;_, _&gt;`\n(expected (),\n    found enum `core::result::Result`) [E0308]\n&lt;std macros&gt;:5 return $ crate:: result:: Result:: Err (\n&lt;std macros&gt;:6 $ crate:: convert:: From:: from ( err ) ) } } )\nread_a_file.rs:5:17: 5:44 note: in this expansion of try! (defined in &lt;std macros&gt;)\n&lt;std macros&gt;:5:8: 6:42 help: run `rustc --explain E0308` to see a detailed explanation\nerror: aborting due to previous error\n\nOkay, seriously?  I feel like I jumped in the Haskell pool after drinking a C++ template error cocktail.  What is that?\nLuckily after asking around, I was finally able to piece together what was going wrong.  The hint lies in these lines:\n expected `()`,\n    found `core::result::Result&lt;_, _&gt;`\n\nAh, some type mismatch is happening.  Our main function doesn't return anything, which is the () in the 'expected' above, but try! only works inside functions that return a Result.  This might be the first time in my life I've ever seen a function in a C-style language that was callable only inside functions of a particular type.\nShouldn't be too hard to fix, just put it in a function that returns Result, right?\nuse std::io;\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nfn read_file() -&gt; Result&lt;(), io::Error&gt; {\n    let mut f = try!(File::open(\"foo.txt\"));\n    Ok(())\n}\nfn main() {\n    read_file();\n}\n\nYup, that did it.  Then I promptly closed my editor and walked away.  I mean, this thing just felt alien.  Unnatural.  Gross.\nWhat I didn't realize was that a few weeks later I'd grok the genius in this approach.\nGenius #1 - Unlike try/catch, try! is precise\nLet's look at a real-life example from a project I'm working on:\nfn load_data(fname: &amp;String) -&gt; Result&lt;Data, io::Error&gt; {\n  let mut f = try!(File::open(fname));\n  let num_pages = try!(f.read_u8()) * 4;\n \n  let mut pages : Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; = Vec::new();\n  for _ in 0..num_pages {\n      let mut buffer = [0; 4096];\n      try!(f.read(&amp;mut buffer));\n      \n      pages.push(buffer.iter().cloned().collect());\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\nIt may take your eyes a minute to adjust to the new syntax, but knowing what we know, we can look at the code above and know exactly which functions might give us errors.  The try!() call even works on calls that are part of an expression, like try!(f.read_u8()) * 4.\nCompare this to traditional try/catch blocks and how they tend to get put around whole sections of code when in reality only parts of the code blocks may throw exceptions.  The end result is code that's very clear and doesn't muddy exceptional code and value-based code together.\nGenius #2 - Feels like exceptions\nWith this little bit of syntax, we get something that is value-based, but still feels like exceptions.\nLet's say your task is to write code that will load a variety of audio file formats.  In each audio format loader, you have various subsections that get loaded (eg, a header, a metadata chunk, a chunk of audio data, etc).  It'd be great if you could create specialized functions for each.  If there are any errors, you just want to bubble that back out to the original caller loading the file.  The resulting code may look something like:\nfn load_header(file: &amp;mut File) -&gt; Result&lt;Header, io::Error&gt; {\n  Ok(Header { header_block: try!(file.read_u32()) })\n}\n\nfn load_metadata(file: &amp;mut File) -&gt; Result&lt;Metadata, io::Error&gt; {\n  Ok(Metadata { metadata_block: try!(file.read_u32()) })\n}\n\nfn load_audio(file: &amp;mut File) -&gt; Result&lt;Audio, io::Error&gt; {\n  let header = try!(load_header(file));\n  let metadata = try!(load_metadata(file));\n  Ok(Audio { header: header, metadata: metadata })\n}\n\nWe can refactor our file loading into helper functions, and we continue to use the same familiar try! pattern.  How does this work?  The trick is that all the Results agree that io::Error is the error case.  If one of my helper functions hits a bad read and has to return an error, that error naturally bubbles all the way out without calling any additional code.\nThe end result is that we have precise syntax that is transparent about errors at every layer, stays pretty lightweight, and gives us the familiar \"bubble out\" feel of languages with exceptions.\nTrade-offs\nOf course, there are trade-offs.  We end up repeating try!() in places we might have just wrapped in one big try/catch block.  For example, the fix to our earlier use case might look like this:\nlet num_chans = try!(read_u16_le(&amp;mut f));\nlet samples_per_sec = try!(read_u32_le(&amp;mut f));\nlet avg_bytes_per_sec = try!(read_u32_le(&amp;mut f));\nlet block_align = try!(read_u16_le(&amp;mut f));\nlet bits_per_sample = try!(read_u16_le(&amp;mut f));\n\nPersonally, I'm happy making the trade-off for the added precision.\nWe also saw another trade-off earlier.  If you use try!() in a function that doesn't return a Result, you get an incomprehensible error message.  But once you know what's going on, you can use it with confidence.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/learning-to-try-things-in-rust/","title":"Learning to 'try!' things in Rust"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/lessons-from-first-12-euler-problems-in/":{"body":"!!

If you haven't solved these for yourself yet, I highly recommend taking the time to solve them on your own first.\nBackground\nBefore I went to Microsoft for a stint in JavaScript, I did my fair share of systems programming in C++.  I've built compilers, head-tracking software, signal processing software, and emulators and even did some of my first programming language projects in it and for it.\nSo when word got out four years ago about a new systems language called Rust, I was intrigued.  I mean, it was new and it was called rust.  Obviously there was some cheekiness involved :)\nWhile I've dabbled with it before, this week was the first time I really gave it some dedicated time to learn it.  TL;DR: hey, this is kinda neat!\nIn this post I talk through solving some of the Euler problems in Rust, both de-rusting my programming skills and learning what this Rust thing was all about.\nIf you're interested, you can grab the source code to my solutions.\nProblem 1\n\"sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000\"\nfn main() {\n    let mut answer = 0;\n \n    for x in 0..1000 {\n        if x % 3 == 0 {\n            answer += x;\n        }\n        else if x % 5 == 0 {\n            answer += x;\n        }\n    }\n \n    println!(\"{}\", answer);\n}\n\nMy solution to problem 1 is pretty straightforward, but you can already start to see some of the characteristic earmarks of Rust.  On line 2, there's a let keyword which creates a variable.  After that is the mut keyword for saying that the variable we're creating is mutable, as variables are immutable by default.\nLine 4 shows off using an iterator.  Rust's iterators are lazy, meaning they generate values only as needed.  This gives them some cool properties, which we'll see later, but it has the property of being relatively cheap to iterate over them, since we don't generate a full range before iteration starts.\nLine 5 reminds us that we're not in C.  The if doesn't require parens around its condition.  Indeed, if you put them there, the compiler warns you that you don't need them.\nLine 13 shows how to print out a value.  Note the '!' after println.  If you're like me, you're bound to leave this off once or twice and get an incomprehensible error message.  Similar to C and many other languages, you pass println! a format string.  Here, we just use \"{}\".  The {} part means to use a default output of the argument we pass in, which in our case just writes out the number.\nProblem 2\n\"sum of even fibonacci below 4,000,000\"\nstruct Fibonacci {\n    curr: u64,\n    next: u64,\n}\n\n// Implement 'Iterator' for 'Fibonacci'\nimpl Iterator for Fibonacci {\n    type Item = u64;\n    // The 'Iterator' trait only requires the 'next' method to be defined. The\n    // return type is 'Option&lt;T&gt;', 'None' is returned when the 'Iterator' is\n    // over, otherwise the next value is returned wrapped in 'Some'\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;u64&gt; {\n        let new_next = self.curr + self.next;\n        \n        self.curr = self.next;\n        self.next = new_next;\n        \n        // 'Some' is always returned, this is an infinite value generator\n        Some(self.curr)\n    }\n}\n\n// Returns a fibonacci sequence generator\nfn fibonacci() -&gt; Fibonacci {\n    Fibonacci { curr: 1, next: 1 }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut sum:u64 = 0;\n    for i in fibonacci().take_while(|&amp;x| x &lt; 4000000).filter(|&amp;x| x % 2 == 0) {\n        sum += i;\n    }\n    println!(\"sum: {}\", sum);\n}\n\nLest you think that I somehow jumped from beginner level to advanced in a few minutes, rest assured that I used the tried and true method of the copy/paste.  In trying to find out how to make an iterator so I could iterate over a fibonacci sequence, I found the source to do just that.  Ah, the internet.\nThere's a fair bit going on here, so let's break it down by line.\nLines 1-4: Create a simple struct to hold the current value to be returned as well as the next value.  Fibonacci needs at least these two values to continue to calculate each iteration.\nLine 7: Now Rust is showing off the fancy.  What is going on here?  In Rust, a type, like our Fibonacci struct from lines 1-4, can implement a trait.  What's a trait?  Think of it as a small contract with the compiler.  If you can show how your type satisfies all the requirements of the contract, then wherever that trait is required, the compiler knows how to use your type.  In this example, we want to use our type in the for..in language feature.  In some languages, this wouldn't be possible.  In Rust, if we can satisfy the Iterator trait, the compiler has enough information to allow that type to be used in the for..in feature.\nLine 8: Ah the problem with copy/paste.  As I started writing this blog post, I had no idea what that line was doing.  Docs to the rescue.  It turns out that this line is saying what the 'associated type' is.  With some traits, there's going to be both a) the type that is implementing the trait (here: our Fibonacci struct) and b) an additional type that needs to be known to get the rest of the story.  For us, since we're creating an iterator over the fibonacci sequence, we need to let Rust know what the type of each \"turn of the crank\" on the iterator will output.  Each fibonacci number will be a 64-bit unsigned integer, so we use the Rust short-hand type u64.\nLines 12-20: Here's where we describe how to turn the crank for each step of our iterator.  We calculate what the next turn will output and then return the current value.  This allows us to keep one in reserve ready to be used to calculate the next value, and so on.  You can see on line 19 that instead of just returning a u64 directly, we instead say that it's optionally a u64.  While in our case we iterate forever, using Option here gives us a way to shut off the valve and finish the iterator if we ever wanted to. \nNotice, too, on line 19 the value is said last and the return statement is elided.  This is just shorthand for returning a value from the function.\nLines 24-26: Create a simple function to give us our starting value to begin our fibonacci sequence.  You can see a couple Rust-isms here, too.  As before, a value by itself is an implied return value.  It also shows how to create an instance of the struct without a constructor.\nLine 30: We're finally in the main!  I've forgotten what problem we were solving by now.  Ah right, \"find the sum of even fibonacci numbers less than 4,000,000\".  Let's look at the solution.  Since there's a lot going on in this fluent-style approach, let's break it up into steps:\nfibonacci() - we call our function and get out the default value to start iterating with.  Since we already told Rust how to use values of this type as iterators, it gets all the capabilities that iterators have.\n.take_while(|&amp;x| x &lt; 4000000) - that didn't take long, we're already jumping in and using the functionality of the iterator to check each turn of the crank, and if we exceed 4,000,000 stop.\nThe |&amp;x| x &lt; 4000000 is a simple function that takes in a reference to each element we bind to x, and then we check the value we're handed in the body of our function.  If you're coming from C++, this reference style might look a little strange.  Aren't you risking someone updating the value?  Turns out Rust's references are immutable by default.  The reference here also shows us the performance characteristics of .take_while.  By this I mean, when we look at the .take_while call, we see it will only pass references, so know ahead of time if we're iterating over big structures, we're not paying the price of copying each one with each step of the iterator.\nSpeaking of performance, it may look like .take_while is going to be exceedingly expensive.  Is it consuming all of our fibonacci sequence until we have all the items we need to get to 4,000,000?  Luckily, it isn't.  Instead, .take_while itself returns an iterator that you can continue your fluent calls on.  I think of it like a series of machines in a factory:\n-&gt; [  ] -&gt; [  ] -&gt; [  ] -&gt;\n\nIf I start the conveyor up and I pull from the right hand, I'm moving whatever was on the far left all the way through the system.  In our case, we're starting up the fibonacci iterator and getting that machine running.  It spits out a single fibonacci-shaped number for us.  This number chugs along and enters the next machine, which is our machine that checks if it's too big.  If it's not, the conveyor chugs along and out drops a single fibonacci-shaped number of the acceptable size.\nAs these machines work in lock-step, we're getting just what we need when we need it rather than trying to run ahead and doing a bunch of work in advance.  This allows you compose a lot of steps together and still stay efficient.\n.filter(|&amp;x| x % 2 == 0) -  Just like .take_while above, this one checks each number as it passes through.  This time, it only lets the number through if it's divisible by 2, and hence even.\nNow we have all the steps in place, each time we turn the crank of the whole iterator, only fibonacci numbers that are less than 4,000,000 and even will pop out.\nLine 31: We've already done all the hard work.  Now we just have to sum those numbers together.\nWith that, we're done.  While it was quite a mouthful, we can see the compositional nature of Rust, a bit of the type system, and how iterators work in more detail.\nProblem 3\n\"highest prime factor of 600851475143\"\nfn is_prime(num:u64) -&gt; bool {\n    for i in 2..(num / 2 + 1) {\n        if num % i == 0 {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true; \n}    \n\nstruct Prime {\n    curr: u64,\n}\n\nimpl Iterator for Prime {\n    type Item = u64;\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;u64&gt; {\n        let mut new_next = self.curr + 1;\n        while !is_prime(new_next) {\n            new_next += 1;\n        }\n\n        self.curr = new_next;\n\n        Some(self.curr)\n    }\n}\n\n\n// Returns the primes\nfn primes() -&gt; Prime {\n    Prime { curr: 1 }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut num:u64 = 600851475143;\n    let mut highest_prime_factor = 0;\n    \n    for i in primes() {\n        if num % i == 0 {\n            highest_prime_factor = i;\n        }\n        while (num % i == 0) &amp;&amp; (num &gt;= 2) {\n            num /= i;\n        }\n        if num == 1 {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    println!(\"num: {}\", highest_prime_factor);\n}\n\nVery similar to Problem #2 above, I create an implementation of Iterator, so I can use it later.  This time, rather than creating a stream of fibonacci values, I create a stream of prime numbers.\nJust like we had a struct for Fibonacci in Problem #2, I create one here for Prime numbers.  Since we don't need the previous one to calculate the next one, I only keep the current value around and then start with that number + 1 when trying to find the next prime.\nOnce we have our iterator, we take each prime, and then try to divide out all its multiples from our give number.  What's left should be our highest prime factor.  Easy peasy.\nPS: I know it's probably already too late, but I should have warned you to avert your eyes from my inefficient prime number skills :)\nProblem 4\n\"largest palindrome product of two 3-digit numbers\"\nfn is_palindrome(num: u64) -&gt; bool {\n    let s = num.to_string();\n    for (i1, i2) in s.chars().zip(s.chars().rev()) {\n        if i1 != i2 {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut largest = 0;\n    for i in 100..999 {\n        for j in 100..999 {\n            if is_palindrome(i * j) &amp;&amp; ((i * j) &gt; largest) {\n                largest = i * j;\n                println!(\"Largest: {}, {} x {}\", largest, i, j);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nProblem #4 also uses some iterators to find the palindrome product (line 13 and line 14).  If it finds a palindrome product, and that new product is larger than what it saw before, it replaces it with the new one.\nThere's one fun trick in this solution on line 3.  We need to check if the number is a palindrome.  While you can do this numerically, I couldn't help but use some more iterators.  This time, after converting the number to a string, we create an iterator over the characters in the string (using .chars()).  We want to see if the number is a palindrome, so one way to test this is that if we reverse the string and if still get the same value, we know we've got one.\nThat's exactly what we do.  Here, I use .zip(s.chars().rev()) to combine the iterator that goes forward over the characters with one that goes in reverse.  The .zip() call brings both iterators together and iterates over both iterators for us, returning a pair (or tuple) of values.  Think of it running both machines side by side, and with each turn of the crank one value pops out of each and zip returns both values tied together with a bow.\nNow that we have a single pair, we immediately use it.  At the beginning of line 3, you can see the for (i1, i2) in part of the line.  Just as before for..in will run over the iterator.  We know that the iterator is going to be outputting pairs of values.  We could have just grabbed the pair as a single value and used it later, but here I go one step further by taking the pair the iterator gives me and pulling it apart so I can use it.  This pulling apart, called destructuring, is a handy way of working with structured data when you're interested in its constituent parts rather than the structure itself.  In this case, this lets me more easily compare the left side to the right side, so I destructure the pair into two values: i1 and i2.\nProblems 5 through 7\nProblems #5, #6, and #7 are all straightforward and don't show off anything new in the language.  Let's jump ahead to the next interesting one.\nProblem 8\n\"largest product of 13 adjacent digits\"\nfn main() {\n    let input = \n        \"73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934\\\n        96983520312774506326239578318016984801869478851843\\\n        85861560789112949495459501737958331952853208805511\\\n        12540698747158523863050715693290963295227443043557\\\n        66896648950445244523161731856403098711121722383113\\\n        62229893423380308135336276614282806444486645238749\\\n        30358907296290491560440772390713810515859307960866\\\n        70172427121883998797908792274921901699720888093776\\\n        65727333001053367881220235421809751254540594752243\\\n        52584907711670556013604839586446706324415722155397\\\n        53697817977846174064955149290862569321978468622482\\\n        83972241375657056057490261407972968652414535100474\\\n        82166370484403199890008895243450658541227588666881\\\n        16427171479924442928230863465674813919123162824586\\\n        17866458359124566529476545682848912883142607690042\\\n        24219022671055626321111109370544217506941658960408\\\n        07198403850962455444362981230987879927244284909188\\\n        84580156166097919133875499200524063689912560717606\\\n        05886116467109405077541002256983155200055935729725\\\n        71636269561882670428252483600823257530420752963450\";\n\n    let mut largest = 0;\n    let input_bytes = input.as_bytes();\n    let mut largest_string: &amp;[u8] = &amp;input_bytes[0..1];\n\n    let span_width = 13;\n\n    for i in 0..(input_bytes.len() - span_width + 1) {\n        let mut sum = 1u64;\n        for j in 0..(span_width) {\n            sum *= (input_bytes[i + j] - 48) as u64;\n        }\n        if sum &gt; largest {\n            largest = sum;\n            largest_string = &amp;input_bytes[i..(i+span_width)];\n        }\n    }\n\n    println!(\"Largest: {} is {:?}\", largest, std::str::from_utf8(largest_string));\n}\n\nIn Problem #8, we see an example of working with strings, this time using a new feature called a 'slice'.  We start with the block from line 3 to line 22 that gives us this giant input string.  Notice that I use the backslash '' to continue the line to the next line.  Rust is smart enough to let us indent without introducing new whitespace into the string. \nNow that we have our string, on line 25 we turn it into a array of bytes we can search through.  Notice we didn't use .chars() this time.  Recall that .chars() gave us an iterator.  Rather than iterating over one value at a time here, we want the flexibility to look across spans in our string.  To do that, we use .as_bytes() to get an array (technically, a byte slice).\nLine 26 introduces the slice we'll use.  A slice is a window into values in memory.  Since we want to look at a span of values, we create a holder for this slice.  We'll later set it to spans of our 13 adjacent digits.  PS: you'll notice I set it to a dummy default value, which I later throw away.  This is to get around the compiler warning about uninitialized values.\nThe rest of the search follows fairly naturally.  We do an iterator over the indices in our input, stopping short of the length of the span.  We use that index to calculate the product at that span (line 32 to line 34).  Once we find a match, we save it off, using a slice to save off the winning span (line 37).\nFinally, we use another format string {:?}, which can print out our winning span for us using the debug formatter.  The {:?} format is a handy builtin which can handle a wider range of types with a default formatter.\nProblem 9\nProblem #9 is another solution that's simple and doesn't show off any new features.  Moving on.\nProblem 10\n\"sum of all primes below 2 million\"\nfn main() {\n    let mut sum = 0;\n    const SIZE: usize = 2000000;\n    let mut slots: [bool; SIZE] = [true; SIZE];\n    slots[0] = false;\n    slots[1] = false;\n    \n    // We calculate the primes using a simple stride and marking off multiples \n    for stride in 2..(SIZE/2) {\n        let mut pos = stride;\n        while pos &lt; (SIZE - stride) {\n            pos += stride;\n            slots[pos] = false;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    for (idx, pr) in slots.into_iter().enumerate() {\n        if *pr { sum += idx; }\n    }\n\n    println!(\"Sum: {}\", sum);\n}\n\nReading the problem description, you might have guessed that I would use the iterator solution from earlier.  The astute reader probably already noticed that doing so would be. very. slow.  Especially, as we look at primes above a million, where each step is itself taking hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of calculations.  While I could let it run and heat up my apartment, it's better to do a more direct approach.\nWe trade space for time. \nOn line 4, I create my first fixed size array that will hold whether or not the number in that position is prime.  Once we have the variable, it's initialized using another cool shorthand: [true; SIZE].  This creates an array of boolean true values of the size given on the right of the ';', here the SIZE constant I defined.  For example, you can create a 500-element array of zeros using [0; 500].  Neat.\nOnce we have our slots, we loop over them using any possible multiple and check that off the list by setting that position to false.  Once we're done, we have an array that tells us where the primes are. \nThe only trick remaining is how to get the numbers back out again.  To do this, we use the iterator on line 17.  Similar to our fluent iterators before, this time we turn our array of slots into an iterator, and then call .enumerate().  The .enumerate() call is a special kind of zip that gives us the index at that point in the iteration paired with the actual value.  Just as before, we destructure the index and the boolean that indicates if it's a prime number separately.\nOn line 18, we check if the number is prime, and if so we add it to our sum.  You'll notice the *pr call here.  Just as in C, this lets me dereference and get at the value at that location in memory.  I could have instead written for (idx, &amp;pr) in and just gotten to the value that way, using destructuring instead of dereferencing.  With that change, the line would have been if pr { ... }, and I could get at the value pr without needing to dereference.\nProblem 11\n\"find the largest product in a grid\"\nlet input = \"\\\n    08 02 22 97 38 15 00 40 00 75 04 05 07 78 52 12 50 77 91 08 \\\n    49 49 99 40 17 81 18 57 60 87 17 40 98 43 69 48 04 56 62 00 \\\n    81 49 31 73 55 79 14 29 93 71 40 67 53 88 30 03 49 13 36 65 \\\n    52 70 95 23 04 60 11 42 69 24 68 56 01 32 56 71 37 02 36 91 \\\n    22 31 16 71 51 67 63 89 41 92 36 54 22 40 40 28 66 33 13 80 \\\n    24 47 32 60 99 03 45 02 44 75 33 53 78 36 84 20 35 17 12 50 \\\n    32 98 81 28 64 23 67 10 26 38 40 67 59 54 70 66 18 38 64 70 \\\n    67 26 20 68 02 62 12 20 95 63 94 39 63 08 40 91 66 49 94 21 \\\n    24 55 58 05 66 73 99 26 97 17 78 78 96 83 14 88 34 89 63 72 \\\n    21 36 23 09 75 00 76 44 20 45 35 14 00 61 33 97 34 31 33 95 \\\n    78 17 53 28 22 75 31 67 15 94 03 80 04 62 16 14 09 53 56 92 \\\n    16 39 05 42 96 35 31 47 55 58 88 24 00 17 54 24 36 29 85 57 \\\n    86 56 00 48 35 71 89 07 05 44 44 37 44 60 21 58 51 54 17 58 \\\n    19 80 81 68 05 94 47 69 28 73 92 13 86 52 17 77 04 89 55 40 \\\n    04 52 08 83 97 35 99 16 07 97 57 32 16 26 26 79 33 27 98 66 \\\n    88 36 68 87 57 62 20 72 03 46 33 67 46 55 12 32 63 93 53 69 \\\n    04 42 16 73 38 25 39 11 24 94 72 18 08 46 29 32 40 62 76 36 \\\n    20 69 36 41 72 30 23 88 34 62 99 69 82 67 59 85 74 04 36 16 \\\n    20 73 35 29 78 31 90 01 74 31 49 71 48 86 81 16 23 57 05 54 \\\n    01 70 54 71 83 51 54 69 16 92 33 48 61 43 52 01 89 19 67 48\";\n    \nlet input_split = input.split_whitespace();\nlet input_as_num: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = input_split.map(|x| \n    match i32::from_str_radix(x, 10) {\n        Ok(v) =&gt; v,\n        Err(u) =&gt; { println!(\"Garbage in input: {}\", u); 0 }\n    }\n).collect();\n\nI'm only showing the interesting part of the solution since it's a bit long, but you can read the whole solution.\nHere we do a bit more string manipulation using some new methods.  The .split_whitespace() method on line 23 lets us turn our input string into an iterator of strings, splitting at any whitespace. \nOnce we have this iterator, line 24 takes this iterator and maps a function over it.  This function attempts to convert each substring to a signed 32-bit integer i32 using the .from_str_radix(x, 10) call.  This call returns a Result, a way of handling either a success or failure condition of an action that might fail.  As is the case with converting from strings to numbers, if you happen to pass in something that can't be converted to a number, there needs to be a way to signal back out that the conversion failed.  Some languages do this through exceptions, which break out of normal execution and give you an error you can handle.  Rust uses a simpler, more functional approach and treats errors as just any other value.  With this method, the type system encourages us to be vigilant and always have code available to handle errors.\nTo see which of success/failure is returned, we use the match keyword.  Just as in other languages with pattern matching, the match keyword lets us ask which of the possible values is in the Result: Ok or Err.  Pattern matching lets us destructure and find the success value or error message.\nFinally, on line 29, we use the .collect() method to run through the iterator and create a vector of i32.\nProblem 12\n\"triangle number with over 500 divisors\"\nfn main() {\n    let mut num = 0u64;\n\n    // Cache the primes we'll be using\n    let first_primes: Vec&lt;u64&gt; = primes().take(1000).collect();\n\n    for i in 1..1000000u64 {\n        num += i;\n\n        let mut num_div = 1u64;\n\n        let mut num_tmp = num;\n        for &amp;x in &amp;first_primes {\n            let prime = x;\n            if (num % prime) == 0 {\n                let mut exponent = 1;\n\n                while (num_tmp % prime) == 0 {\n                    exponent += 1;\n                    num_tmp /= prime;\n                }\n                num_div *= exponent;\n            }\n            if num_tmp == 1 { break; }\n        }\n\n        if num_div &gt; 500 {\n            println!(\"num: {}\", num);\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAgain we'll trim down to the interesting parts, since we've seen the prime iterator before, but you can read the full file.\nThis looks pretty familiar.  On line 5, we run our primes iterator, take enough to use later, and turn that into a Vec&lt;u64&gt; we can use a bunch of times.\nThe other interesting line is line 13.  If you've played with vectors in Rust before, you know that you can iterate over them, like this:\n{% highlight rust %}\nfn main() {\nlet x: Vec = (1..10).collect();\nfor i in x {\n    println!(\"{}\", i);\n}\n\n}\n{% endhighlight %}\nBut if we try to do this in our Euler problem, we get a new error:\nerror: use of moved value: `first_primes`\n\nWhat is a moved value?\nIt turns out that a moved value is part of Rust's ownership system.  Just like the first time a programmer sees a pointer in C or a monad in Haskell, ownership in Rust is one of those things that's so uniquely Rust that it takes getting used to.  Once you begin to understand it, you'll be able to see how the type system is trying to help you describe your intentions a bit more clearly.\nIf you're scratching your head, here's an example: imagine malloc'ing an array in C and then passing that malloc'ed array into a function.  Who is responsible for cleaning up that memory, the function you called or the function that created the array?  In C, you don't know by looking at the code, you only know as the writer of the code what your intention was.  Maybe the function is called 'cleanup' at which case, yes, you do want it to free that memory.  Or maybe the function is called 'inspect' and you decidedly don't want it to free the memory.  This is why Rust makes this very explicit.  By looking at the code, you can follow who is responsible for what.  The set of checks that do this make up Rust's ownership system.\nThere are a lot of resources to understand ownership,which do a good job of explaining ownership in detail.  For us, ownership is like trying to answer questions like \"who is responsible for this thing?\" and \"when does this thing get removed?\"  Ownership can be passed from variable to variable, and its strictly checked by the compiler.\nWhen you first encounter the above error, if you haven't already read about ownership, you might be in for a few hours of reading to get caught up.  But we have some hints here that we can get started with to help figure out what's happening.\nIn our small example, we could iterate over a vector and all was well.  When did things start to go wrong in the Euler problem?\nOn line 13, we want to loop over a vector, and when we look out to line 7, we see this is actually an inner loop being used by an outer loop.  That means that if the inner loop takes control of our vector, the next time around the outer loop we've lost the ownership.\nWe don't want the inner loop to take ownership and then lose the ability to use the vector again in the next iteration of the loop, so we have to 'borrow' ownership.  As the name implies, by borrowing, we're only taking temporary ownership for a time, and we have to follow all the rules stated when we borrow.  With that in mind, let's look at line 13 again:\nfor &amp;x in &amp;first_primes\n\nWe borrow first_primes instead of taking permanent ownership using the &amp; operator.  This operator says \"I would like to borrow first_primes, and I can not edit the contents\".  The compiler will then be able to check that we're using what we've borrowed correctly.  You might be curious borrowing and also being able to mutate.  To do that, we could've used the &amp;mut operator assuming the original vector was mutable.\nFinally, we use the same destructure trick we did earlier to get at the values of x.\nPS: In this example, since all we were doing was iterating, we could have used the .iter() rather than borrowing, though that won't always be the case in other examples that need more direct interaction with the vector.\nCargo\nAfter I got enough of these problems together that I got tired of building them by hand, I moved over to using Cargo.  Cargo is Rust's build/package tool that is quite handy.\n[package]\n\nname = \"eulerinrust\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\n\n[[bin]]\nname = \"ex1\"\npath = \"src/ex1.rs\"\n\nAn example of Cargo.toml\nCargo lets you describe dependencies that your project needs, which it fetches from crates.io.  You can also control whether you're doing a release or debug build, and quite a bit more.  I'll no doubt start directly with Cargo for any future Rust projects.\nSummary\nThese are just tiny examples created while playing around in a fairly simple set of problems, and yet there's actually quite a lot of Rust's richness shining through.  Rust has a powerful iterator story that feels composable and clear.  Rust's error checking is keeping us vigilant about handling error cases, matching types, and remembering who is responsible for values in the system.  Overall, it feels like a very well thought-out language that holds together well.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/lessons-from-first-12-euler-problems-in/","title":"Lessons from the first 12 Euler problems in Rust"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/nushell-0-3-0/":{"body":"Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.\nWe're happy to announce that today we're releasing Nushell 0.3.0. Nu has seen numerous bugfixes, performance improvements, and features added since its initial public release (which was only a few weeks ago!)\nWhere to get it\nNu 0.3.0 is available as pre-built binaries or from crates.io. If you have Rust installed you can install it using cargo +nightly install nu (or if you want all the features cargo +nightly install nu --all-features).\nWhat's new\nNew table design (Porges, jntrnr)\n\nOne of the most striking differences is that Nu now uses UTF-8 box drawing to draw its tables. \n\nThe table is also configurable. If you feel like the table is a bit too heavy, you can also configure it to work in light mode using this command:\n&gt; config --set [table_mode light]\nNew file formats (pmeredit, est31, andrasio, jntrnr)\nNu now natively supports new file formats, including: bson, tsv, sqlite, and url-encoded strings.\nNew commands (incrop, ramonsnir, ijt, jntrnr, andrasio, JonnyWalker81, chhetripradeep, pka)\nSince the 0.2.0 release, Nu has gained a set of additional commands, including:\n\nhelp - built-in help system\nreverse - reverse a table\nlast - like the first command, but working from the bottom of the table, return n rows\nembed - create a new table using the current table as a start\nfetch - get the contents of a URL (this originally lived in open)\npost - post to a URL and get the results\npwd - print the working directory\nenv - give access to a number of important paths and environment settings\npivot - pivot a table so that rows become columns and vice-versa\necho - a built-in echo command\n\nError improvements (jntrnr)\n\nWe've made steady progress on improving error messages. Recently, we added \"did you mean?\" errors to help when you mistype the name of columns. Nu 0.3.0 also has gone through a few passes to generally polish the errors to include more information when an error occurs.\nShell features (pka, wycats, twe4ked, andrasio, iamcodemaker)\nNu now supports ~ to refer to your home directory as part of a path.  You can also use cd - to return to a previous directory you were working in.\nThe shell itself also got a few updates. You can now enable 'vi' mode, if you'd prefer vi-like bindings (by running config --set [edit_mode vi]). On non-Windows platforms, you can also use Ctrl-R to enable Sublime-style history searching (we're hoping to enable Windows support for this soon).\nPlugin improvements (jntrnr, andrasio)\nPlugins have continued to mature, and it's now possible to use plugins to extend Nu with support for new file formats.\nWe've also added documentation on how to write Nu plugins in both Rust and Python, with info on Ruby coming soon.\nDocker support (vsoch, DrSensor)\nIf you're interested in using Nu and Docker together, be sure to check out the new Docker support.\nBook progress\nThe Nu book is now available in three languages: English, Spanish, and Japanese.\nWe've also created a Nu contributor book, which will help developers who want to contribute to Nu learn about its philosophy, design, and how to create plugins.\nAcknowledgements\nest31, pmeredit, twe4ked, DrSensor, vsoch, pka, jankoprowski, Porges, max-sixty, ijt, djc, vthriller, taiki-e, oskarskog, iamcodemaker, JonnyWalker81, yaahc, tim77, svartalf, ramonsnir, orf, lesichkovm, ineol, incrop, eoinkelly, devnought, chhetripradeep, aidanharris, GuillaumeGomez, and BatmanAod for contributing to the Nu codebase.

It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.\nToday we're happy to announce the 0.4.0 release of Nushell.  The 0.4.0 release marks a continually maturing shell that is now starting to show signs of stability.  And, of course, a few fun features along the way.\nWhere to get it\nNu 0.4.0 is available as pre-built binaries or from crates.io. If you have Rust installed you can install it using cargo +beta install nu (or if you want all the features cargo +beta install nu --all-features).\nWhat's new\nNew Colors (wycats)\n\nNew colors!\nWith 0.4.0, we're adding some new colors to show off different types of the command, where errors might be happening, and if the command is internal or external. The coloring is just the tip of the iceberg, as it were, and builds from a reworking of the parser to make it more accurate, more stable, and more feature-complete.\nStreaming table (jntrnr)\n\nStreaming tables\nUp to this point, we've taken a few shortcuts with how streams worked in Nushell.  We knew that a table, in theory, was a stream of rows. In practice, though, this wasn't the case as the code has lots of assumptions about how tables worked.\nWith the 0.4.0, we're taking a big step in the direction of full support for streams.  You'll see that now data will start being printed as it becomes available, with tables printing pages of 50 rows at a time (by default).  This allows you to get deep listings of files (eg using ls **), work with streams from external sources, and more.\nBetter ctrl-c support (jntrnr, landaire)\nAs part of having streams of tables, it's always helpful to be able to say \"stop!\" when you need to. With 0.4.0, using ctrl-c to stop the output should be a lot more responsive and will take you back to the prompt.\nTextview gets VI keys (JonnyWalker81)\nThe built-in text viewer now lets you use vi keys for navigation thanks to JonnyWalker81's work.\nOnto the Beta compiler (est31)\nFor those of you wondering if and when Nu was going to be usable on stable Rust, you need but wait just a little longer. Contributer est31 has been hard at work at moving Nu onto stable Rust and has now successfully moved Nu off of nightly and onto beta. As beta matures and becomes the next release of Rust, we'll be able to move Nu onto stable. This should help people who are working to distribute Nu on various distributions.\nBrazilian Portuguese book (marcelocg)\nContributor marcelocg surprised us with a translation of the Nu book into Brazillian Portuguese. Obrigado, Marcelo!\nNew commands\nfrom-ssv (t-hart)\nTo follow along with our from-csv (comma-separated-values) and from-tsv (tab-separated-values), we now have a new way of handle importing content from commands that output their own tables: from-ssv.  Like its siblings, it looks for values separated by a separator, using the spaces to show where the breaks between cells should be.\nmatch (rnxpyke)\nWe're continuing to evolve our support for matching string data. Recently, we began experimenting with a match command that can find matches in strings for you. We plan to continue experimenting and exploring what's possible in this space in the future.\nLots of new documentation (sdfnz, twe4ked, chhetripradeep, mfarberbrodsky, cristicismas, Charles-Schleich, coolshaurya, notryanb, pema99, gilesv, yahsinhuangtw, JesterOrNot, nalshihabi, marcelocg, sorrell, pizzafox, iggy14750, DrSensor, mlbright, BradyBromley, andrasio, piotrek-szczygiel)\nHappy hacktoberfest!  Lots of people wanted to jump in and help document all of our commands, help fix docs that are already there, and generally give things a bit of polish. Much appreciated everyone who came by and contributed.\nTons of stability fixes (thegedge, jntrnr, wycats, JonnyWalker81, vsoch, pka)\nAs always, there were a bunch of stability and correctness both in Nu and in the CI that support Nu's development\nLooking ahead\nWe'll continuing filling out the features that will let folks use Nu as their everyday shell. Coming up are better support for the environment, path, and for command aliases.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/nushell-0-4-0/","title":"Nushell 0.4.0"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/nushell-0-5-0/":{"body":"Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.\nToday, we're happy to announce the 0.5.0 release for Nu. We've got lots of new features, including some long-requested ones, in this release.\nWhere to get it\nNu 0.5.0 is available as pre-built binaries or from crates.io. If you have Rust installed you can install it using cargo +beta install nu (or if you want all the features cargo +beta install nu --all-features).\nNu as a login shell (jntrnr)\nOne of the key features that landed in 0.5.0 is set of new capabilities that work together to allow you to use Nu as a login shell, completely independent of bash or other hosting shells.  For this, we've built in support for querying and updating the environment variables and the path.\nTo get started, you'll need to first copy the environment you're using into the config. Luckily, we've also made some improvements there:\n&gt; config --set [path $nu:path]\n&gt; config --set [env $nu:env]\n\nOnce these values are set, you'll be able to use Nu as your login shell.\nNew variables\nAs you saw above, we've added a few new built-in variables. These will let you know what the current values that Nu can see are for your environment, path, and the config itself.\n&gt; echo $nu:env\n&gt; echo $nu:path\n&gt; echo $nu:config\nAdding paths to your PATH\nOne of the first things you'll notice is that the new $nu:path is structured. If you run the echo above, you might see something like this:\n&gt; echo $nu:path\n━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n # │ &lt;value&gt; \n───┼──────────────────\n 0 │ /usr/local/sbin \n 1 │ /usr/local/bin \n 2 │ /usr/sbin \n 3 │ /usr/bin \n 4 │ /sbin \n 5 │ /bin \n 6 │ /usr/games \n 7 │ /usr/local/games \n 8 │ /snap/bin \n━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nWe've added two new commands: prepend for adding items to the start of a table and append for adding items to the end of a table.  With these commands, we can now query out the path, update it, and save it back.\n&gt; echo $nu:path | prepend \"/my/new/directory\" | config --set_into path\nAdding variables to your environment\nYou can use a similar set of steps to add new variables, or change existing variables, in your environment.\n&gt; echo $nu:env | insert GREETING hello_world | config --set_into env\n\nNote: the previous add command of previous releases has been renamed insert to remove confusion with mathematical functions.\nOn-going improvements\nWe're continuing to improve the commands we currently ship as part of Nu. Here are a few you might find helpful:\nSubstrings (Flare576)\nThe str command now supports being able to retrieve a substring from the strings given, so you could return, for example, the first 5 characters and stop after that.\n&gt; ls | get name\n━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n #  │ &lt;value&gt; \n────┼────────────────────\n  0 │ target \n  1 │ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md \n  2 │ .cargo \n  3 │ src \n  4 │ features.toml \n  5 │ rustfmt.toml\n&gt; ls | get name | str --substring \"0,3\"\n━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━\n #  │ &lt;value&gt; \n────┼─────────\n  0 │ tar \n  1 │ COD \n  2 │ .ca \n  3 │ src \n  4 │ fea \n  5 │ rus \nRecycling (jdvr)\nEver wish you could rm things, but not forever? You can now tell rm to send items to your platform's recycle bin rather than deleting them forever. As with our other commands, this works across all the platforms that Nu supports.\n&gt; rm myfile.txt --trash\nParameter descriptions (jntrnr)\nWe're also continuing to improve the built-in help system. New in this release are descriptions for the flags and parameters that the command uses.  For example, here's a look at what the help for rm now looks like:\n&gt; help rm\nRemove a file\n\nUsage:\n  &gt; rm &lt;path&gt; {flags} \n\nparameters:\n  &lt;path&gt; the file path to remove\n\nflags:\n  --trash: use the platform's recycle bin instead of permanently deleting\n  --recursive: delete subdirectories recursively\nNew commands\nIn addition to the new append and prepend we mentioned earlier, we've added a few new commands to Nu.\nAverage (notryanb)\nGrowing our set of mathematics functions for working with numbers, we now have an average command which will take the average of values given to it.\n&gt; ls | get size | average\nRead (jntrnr)\nWe've also introduced a new command to load in strings as tables.  This new read command will take a pattern that describes the columns, their names, and where they are in each row of the string.\n&gt; open .editorconfig\nroot = true\n\n[*]\nindent_style = space\nindent_size = 4\ncharset = utf-8\ntrim_trailing_whitespace = true\ninsert_final_newline = false\nend_of_line = lf\n&gt; open .editorconfig | read \"{variable} = {value}\"\n━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━\n # │ variable                 │ value \n───┼──────────────────────────┼───────\n 0 │ root                     │ true \n 1 │ indent_style             │ space \n 2 │ indent_size              │ 4 \n 3 │ charset                  │ utf-8 \n 4 │ trim_trailing_whitespace │ true \n 5 │ insert_final_newline     │ false \n 6 │ end_of_line              │ lf\nBugfixes (jntrnr, JesterOrNot, thegedge, andrasio, wycats, notryanb, Detegr, t-hart)\nAs always, we've had lots of bugfixes. A huge \"thank you!\" to folks who reported issues, fixed issues, and just generally shared their experience with the shell. It's much appreciated and helps to continue making Nu that much better.\nSurvey\nIf you haven't already taken it, we'd love to hear your feedback in a quick (roughly 3 question) survey.\nLooking forward\nThere are a bunch of areas we're currently working on to make Nu more stable and feature complete. Until this work is finished, please consider Nu to be somewhere in the pre-alpha to alpha quality level.\nThat said, we're excited to merge this work and continue to take steps towards a more full-featured shell. Soon to be coming will be Nu working on stable Rust(!!), some improvements in the Nu internal engine which will make it possible to have better streaming and cleaner commands, and features like aliases.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/nushell-0-5-0/","title":"Nushell 0.5.0"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/off-to-new-adventures/":{"body":"A few weeks ago I posted about moving teams inside of Microsoft.

I got to meet countless numbers of people and make some good friends along the way.  It was a wild adventure to be on the team, and I'm excited to see what they come up with next.\nBut as little birds grow, there comes a time to leave the nest and to take more risks. There are many adventures to be had, and to have them, you have to ride out the storms in search of the blue skies.\nMy first step will be to take some time to travel the world and see friends I haven't seen in years.  My goal: recharge, explore, and take stock.  After that, who knows. \nPart of the adventure is not seeing the way ahead and going anyway.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/off-to-new-adventures/","title":"Off to new adventures"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/porting-csharp-nes-emu-to-rust/":{"body":"Many years ago, I created a simple NES emulator in C# using SDL and Mono.  For fun, I wanted to see what it would be like to port that emulator to Rust.  A couple weeks later, after poking on it on and off between packing for a move, I was able to get it working.\n\nWhat I did\nLoading a binary file\nLoading the types of files commonly used in emulators requires us to work with binary files.  To do so, we need a way of loading the raw data both as just plain bytes and also as numbers.  Rust, by default, comes with a fairly slim API for dealing with binary data.  No matter, Rust is also very flexible and allows you to build on additional parts to the API to suit your needs.\nI started there, and built out a few functions that would let me read in the numbers from the file both using big-endian and little-endian.\npub trait BitReader {\n    fn read_u32_be(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;u32, io::Error&gt;;\n    fn read_u32_le(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;u32, io::Error&gt;;\n}\nimpl BitReader for File {\n    fn read_u32_be(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;u32, io::Error&gt; {\n        let mut buffer = [0; 4];\n    \n        try!(self.read(&amp;mut buffer));\n        \n        Ok(buffer[3] as u32 + ((buffer[2] as u32) &lt;&lt; 8) +\n            ((buffer[1] as u32) &lt;&lt; 16) + ((buffer[0] as u32) &lt;&lt; 24))    \n    }\n    fn read_u32_le(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;u32, io::Error&gt; {\n        let mut buffer = [0; 4];\n    \n        try!(self.read(&amp;mut buffer));\n        \n        Ok(buffer[0] as u32 + ((buffer[1] as u32) &lt;&lt; 8) +\n            ((buffer[2] as u32) &lt;&lt; 16) + ((buffer[3] as u32) &lt;&lt; 24))    \n    }\n}\n\nOnce I had the trait, I could import it where I wanted to use these extra read capabilities on File.\nWith these extra methods in place, I could plow through the binary file loading with a mix of the File read functionality and the BitReader trait.\nI did notice I used the odd concoction buffer.iter().cloned().collect() to convert from an array to a Vec of the same contained type:\nfor _ in 0..(num_prg_pages*4) {\n    let mut buffer = [0; 4096];\n    try!(f.read(&amp;mut buffer));\n    prg_rom.push(buffer.iter().cloned().collect());\n}\n\nThere may be a more Rust-native way of doing it.  Personally, I think it'd be nice to be able to read directly into a Vec, so you could elide that step.\nSide-by-side porting\nOne of the first things I did after I had file loading in place was to start porting over the CPU emulation.  Because I wanted the code to be fairy clean, I opted to not do a literal port.  Instead, I opened two separate editor windows: one for the original C# source, and one for the new Rust source.  Tedious, but I hoped that a port focused on what would fit better with Rust would be less error-prone.\nThere's another reason not to do copy/pasting of code when porting: too many little things needed to be changed to the Rust style. For example, Rust-friendly names often differ from the C# equivalent (eg the ReadChrRom method would need to be read_chr_rom to match Rust naming conventions).  Like-wise, little things that help readability in Rust, like the \"no parens around if guards\" means that copy/pasted code would need to be touched up.  All told, a minor frustration, but it gave ample time to make the code look a bit cleaner in the transfer so likely a net win.\nFeeling more comfortable with Rust's use of expressions, I could write code in a more dense way.  For example, here is some code from the ROR or Rotate Right opcode in C#:\nif ((valueholder &amp; 0x1) == 0x1)\n\tbitholder = 1;\nelse\n\tbitholder = 0;\n\t\nvalueholder = (byte)(valueholder &gt;&gt; 1);\n\nif (carry_flag == 1)\n\tvalueholder = (byte)(valueholder | 0x80);\n\ncarry_flag = bitholder;\n\nif ((valueholder &amp; 0xff) == 0x0)\n\tzero_flag = 1;\nelse\n\tzero_flag = 0;\n\t\nif ((valueholder &amp; 0x80) == 0x80)\n\tsign_flag = 1;\nelse\n\tsign_flag = 0;\n\nand here's what it became in Rust:\nlet bit = (value &amp; 0x1) == 0x1;\nvalue = (value &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x7f;\nvalue += if self.carry {0x80} else {0};\nself.carry = bit;\nself.zero = value == 0;\nself.sign = (value &amp; 0x80) == 0x80;  \n\nSome of these changes could have been done in the original C#, but I didn't notice them at the time.  Still, I think the result Rust is still pretty readable, even though it's more compact.\nWhile we're talking about bit rotation, one of the annoyances I experienced working on bit manipulation code is that Rust is more vigilant about overflow checking.  In hindsight, this is actually a good thing, but coming from languages like C# and JavaScript that are less vigilant, it was a bit of a headache to adjust to.  I ended up doing some of my own bit masks so I didn't have to worry about it, but I noticed that they've added a number of \"wrapping\" operations in Rust 1.4 that allow you to work around the overflow checks.\nHitting the first ownership error\nA few days into the port, I hit my first ownership error.  Here's a quick rundown of the NES, so you can see why that might be so:\n\nCPU: The CPU :)\nPPU: The NES's graphics unit\nMMU: Not technically not called the MMU, but let's call it an MMU for our purposes\nCart: The program to run\n\nNow that we have the parts, here's how they talk to each other:\n\nCPU asks the MMU for an instruction, and the CPU may also write back to memory\nPPU reads memory from the Cart, and can also transfer memory from MMU to graphics memory\nMMU needs to read information from the Cart and can also read and write from the PPU\n\nAll the subsystems, in essence, need to be able to talk to each other at some level.  Which is exactly how I set up the C# project.  Singleton objects with references to each other.  When I ported over to TypeScript a few years ago, similar idea.\nBut in Rust, ownership needs to be clear.  If you call a method, you can't also pass something you own to that method, like so:\nfoo.x.y(foo.x.z)\n\nThe net result is that I went back to the drawing board and thought long and hard about what was actually necessary for each component.  After a couple of refactorings, I think I landed on a solution that's both cleaner and clearer.  Every object has one owner, and I don't do any ref cells or ref counting.\nDeriving debug\nThere are a few tricks that I loved in Haskell that I wished other languages would pick up.  One of them is the ability to automatically be able to print out objects for you.\nIn Rust, you can do this using the 'derive' command:\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Foo {\n  x: u32\n}\n//...\n\nlet foo = Foo { x: 10 }\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n\nBy deriving Debug, you have the ability to output a debug format of that structure, which is output using {:?}.\nThis is very handy to help bootstrap a project, when you quickly want to look at the contents of what is working so far.  After a while, I found I ended up removing these helpers and putting in my own, customized implementations.\nSDL\nUsing SDL was dead simple.  I used the SDL2 Rust bindings.  After a few tries to follow the directions to install SDL2 carefully, I had it working in both Windows and OS X.  After it's installed, the bindings \"just work\".\nI'd never used SDL2 before, but after looking through the examples directory, especially the texture sample, I was good to go.\nWhat I didn't do\nChase crashing bugs\nAfter wrestling a few ownership errors, I largely spent my time on correctness.  I ended up having a few hard-to-find issues where I flipped the boolean logic on a check or discovering I forgot to implement a piece of the machine that was required.  After many hours pouring over the code side by side, or looking at the output log, I finally managed to get the outputs similar.\nJust as in the C# and JavaScript versions of the emulator, I didn't worry about any crashes.  A few times I had an arithmetic overflow or error accessing a vector out of bounds, but those were easy to fix.\nOptimize\nAfter I got the emulator working, I let it rip.  The result was something unplayably fast.  Not bad for a first try.\nIn hindsight, this isn't too surprising.  The CPU gets to work directly with the MMU.  Ditto with the MMU and the PPU.  The systems can call functions in each other without any abstraction, VM, or GC.  By default, the core structs sit on the stack.\nUsing Rust had nudged me into doing what would have made sense for a decent C-based approach, without the risks.  Of course, it's not like Rust prevents you from adding in a hefty abstraction layer, but the defaults seem to push you in the right direction. \nUnit test\nFor this to feel like a real Rust project, though, it needs some tests.  I asked Patrick Walton, the author of probably the first NES emulator for Rust, about testing emulators with Rust unit tests, but he didn't use them for his project either.\nStill, I suspect there's a way of creating fairly testable, and still performant, parts of the emulator.  For example, opcodes could each have their own unit test if there was a way, possibly with traits, to decouple them from working so closely with the MMU.\nAdd audio support\nIn Patrick's video about his emulator, he mentions that he took it on to show that Rust can do real-time processing.  For an emulator, that means that the audio is emulated properly and sounds correct.  I haven't added any audio support, but it would be a fun project at some point.\nPrecisely emulate the machine\nThe never-ending rabbit hole for any emulation project is to see just how precisely you can emulate the hardware.  There's plenty of work here.\nWhat I've learned\nI'm getting a little more comfortable with Rust.  Thinking through an ownership refactoring can still take a while, but it's starting to feel like the hurdle you take on so that you can worry less about safety and performance.  I still have a ways to go before it becomes second nature.\nCargo shines again, and the SDL bindings were easy to put in place and worked as expected.  No complaints there.\nFeels like I'm still scratching the surface.  There are likely some slick spots to use traits and macros to cut down on the redundancy and coupling, repectively.  But I'm happy with the progress.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/porting-csharp-nes-emu-to-rust/","title":"Porting a C# NES emulator to Rust"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/porting-the-pikachu/":{"body":"\nLook Mom, Pikachu running in Windows CMD!\nI've been wanting to play around with the cool spinning Pikachu demo everyone was talking about. Sadly, it used termion to do its magic, which meant that unfortunately it wouldn't work for me.\nTermion has been a boon for Rust, with lots of folks using it to create terminal applications. Unfortunately, as a Windows user, I know there's a good chance that if the crate depends on termion that's the end of the line for me, as termion apps just don't work in Windows. Surely, I thought, there must be a better way, but I never managed to find one.\nEnter crossterm\nYesterday, I discovered a crate I have wanted for at least a year: that holy grail of something like termion that also worked crossplatform. The crate is called crossterm, and it is exactly that. Rather than being an exact copy of termion, I'd call Crossterm a termion-like crate. The API surface feels very similar between the two crates, but it's not identical.  That said, often, the translation is 1:1 (or close to it).\nIn this post, I'll detail what I had to do to port to crossterm. You can take a look at my repo and give it a spin.\nMoving to crossterm\nLike termion, crossterm is a single crate to depend on that pulls in what you need for interacting with the terminal:\n-termion = \"1\"\n+crossterm = \"0.9.3\"\n\nNext, is setting up the terminal:\n-    let mut stdout = AlternateScreen::from(stdout().into_raw_mode().unwrap()); // Raw output is clean output\n-    let mut stdin = async_stdin().bytes(); // Async in so input isn't blocking\n+\n+    let crossterm = Crossterm::new();\n+    #[allow(unused)]\n+    let screen = RawScreen::into_raw_mode();\n+    let input = crossterm.input();\n+    let mut stdin = input.read_async();\n+    let cursor = cursor();\n+\n+    cursor.hide()?;\n\nThere are a few more steps here, and I took a slightly different approach than termion. In the original, the author uses an AlternateScreen, a way to easily switch back to the previous terminal with the application exits. The crossterm package supports this, though there were is an issue that's being worked on. Using an AlternateScreen is optional, so I just left it off.\nThe next step was to set up raw mode. Raw mode lets us get user input directly without the normal terminal buffering. The order of operations in crossterm above is important.\nLastly, I hide the cursor so it doesn't mess up the animation.\nThe event loop is similar, though a little more verbose in my version:\n-        let b = stdin.next();\n-        if let Some(Ok(b'q')) = b {\n-            break;\n+        if let Some(b) = stdin.next() {\n+            match b {\n+                InputEvent::Keyboard(event) =&gt; match event {\n+                    KeyEvent::Char('q') =&gt; break,\n+                    _ =&gt; {}\n+                },\n+                _ =&gt; {}\n+            }\n\nThe event systems between termion and crossterm, while similar, are different enough that I preferred to do two-step match to make sure I understood it. Events for both key and mouse come in through the event stream, which is a nice benefit.\nDrawing colors to the screen is also very similar between termion and crossterm:\n-    format!(\"{}{}{}{}\", color::Fg(color::Rgb(bg.0, bg.1, bg.2)),\n-                        color::Bg(color::Rgb(25,25,25)),\n-                      src,\n-                      color::Fg(color::Reset))\n+                    print!(\n+                        \"{}{}{}\",\n+                        Colored::Fg(Color::Rgb {\n+                            r: (pixel.1).0,\n+                            g: (pixel.1).1,\n+                            b: (pixel.1).2\n+                        }),^M\n+                        Colored::Bg(Color::Rgb {\n+                            r: 25,\n+                            g: 25,\n+                            b: 25\n+                        }),\n+                        pixel.0\n+                    )\n\nThe change from color::Fg to Colored::Fg is straightforward enough I did most of these changes with search/replace.\nGotchas\nThe translation is not without its own set of hiccups. The main one of which you get a hint at here:\n-    pub frame_buffer: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n+    pub frame_buffer: Vec&lt;(char, (u8, u8, u8))&gt;,\n\nOriginally, the whole framebuffer was turned into a vector of strings. On most Unix platforms, these would include the ANSI commands to change the color or move the cursor. It's a powerful tool, and being text-based, you can prebuffer the whole frame via string manipulation.\nUnfortunately, assuming everything is string-based doesn't work in Windows. When crossterm outputs using println!, it's calling into the Windows Console API between each piece of the println. This allows the same code to work, assuming it doesn't buffer the string.\nTo work around this, I stopped buffering the string and instead stored the pixel value in the buffer. When it was time, I drew the whole frame using print! statements.\nWhen I first did this, it was noticeably slower than the termion version(roughly 5-10 fps). This is because calling into the Console API that often (once per character) is going to pull down performance.  Luckily, I could work around this by just checking if we were already using the color I wanted to render. If we were, I didn't set the color again. \nPerformance between the termion version and the crossterm version now look the same to me, which I call good enough :)\nConclusion\nWe have a way to move more of our terminal apps to being crossplatform, so that they work out-of-the-box on Windows as well as Unix-based systems. It was fun to write the port, and I did the port in a couple hours without ever having used crossterm before. \nAlso, big thanks to Mitchell Hynes for writing the original!\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/porting-the-pikachu/","title":"Creating crossplatform Rust terminal apps"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/programming-language-and-compilers-reading-list/":{"body":"This week, the talented Julien Fitzpatrick (btw, you should check out their RustConf talk if you haven't already) asked what a good list would be for people who are interested in programming languages and compilers.  I took it as a good excuse to write a blog post with some of my recommendations.  I'm going to attempt to put together a list that doesn't require a lot of background information, but as these things go, sometimes you'll have to re-read portions of books to get their benefit.  Also, this isn't going to be an exhaustive list.  I have never read through an exhaustive reading list before.  Instead, this is definitely biased towards writing real code, getting things working, and learning by doing.  Without further ado, let's get started!\nGetting started\nTo kick things off, the first thing to do is to remove any fears we have about thinking that compilers are big complicated things that are only possible by the most heroic of efforts.  Yes, some compilers can be quite complex, but that's true of many kinds of industrial software.  At its core, though, the compiler just does a few relatively simple things.  So let's demystify those things.\nFirst off, let's make a small compiler.  @thejameskyle has written a cool tutorial that helps take you through the steps of creating a simple compiler.  Rather than chewing your way through dusty tome after dusty tome before you write your first line of code, my suggestion would be to always have a code editor open at each step of the way.  Play with the ideas as you learn them.\nAlright, next, after we've played around with our little compiler and made a few changes and see how our changes affect the output, it's time to start building up our knowledge.  Fundamentally, how a programming language works can be described in abstractions that build on other abstractions.  If we peel these abstractions away, we're left with a pretty simple foundation.\nOne of the compiler books I liked that help build up these abstractions from a simple base is Jeremy Siek's compiler course.  The notes are laid out by chapter, and each chapter introduces a new concept that you'll add to the compiler.  I enjoyed the hands-on approach, since you can think about how each feature affects each part of the compiler.  It definitely gave me a \"oh my god, I can't believe this works!\" moments.  You may also want to adjust to fit your particular style. For example, if something like the assembly piece feels awkward, you could instead output code to a language you're more familiar with, and work through the other steps of the compiler.\nOn the programming language side, probably one of the better survey books I've seen is Programming Language Pragmatics.  I'd probably pair it with something like Masterminds of Programming or Coders at Work.  These two books are interviews with programming language creators.  Creating programming languages is definitely equal parts art and engineering, and bouncing between the creators talking about the art and seeing how the engineering works in practice might help see parts of the picture a bit clearer.\nWorking some problems\nI used to hate doing homework.  I mean, who didn't?  But getting a little older, I realize just how useful doing some of the problems in the book can be.  That's the time where you actually are solving little puzzles.  And, if you're lucky, it's also a great chance to have one of those \"a ha!\" moments that unlock the next set of secrets.\nIf you're like I was at the time, you've heard of \"functional programming\" about a million times but weren't sure why anyone should care all that much.  It wasn't really until I was working through Introduction to Functional Programming by Bird/Wadler that things started to click.  The problems in this book are great.  They're juicy enough that you might have to work at them a little, but you come away with a much better sense of the concepts in each chapter.\nAnother book I enjoyed the problems in is the Dragon book.  The problem with the Dragon book, though, is that it definitely feels like a stuffy college textbook. That said, it's worth a skim.  My favorite part about it are the problems in the earlier chapters.  Working through those gave me a bit more confidence I understood the concepts.\nGetting more modern\nPerhaps another problem with the well-known dragon book is that the dragon is a bit long in the tooth these days.  Modern techniques have moved on a bit from where they were a few decades ago.\nOne thing to check out to see a bit more of how modern compilers work is the LLVM chapter of Architecture of Open Source Applications (which may also be a fun read for someone interested in how things work generally).\nI don't know of a good book on this topic, but there's a good video that goes into some of the ways that modern compilers work differently than those in the dragon book.\nFor the brave\nWhen you've worked your way to this point and are feeling pretty confident, it's time to scale to the dizzying heights.  To get there, you'll inevitably come across Types and Programming Languages (which you might hear pronounced \"tapple\").  I'm not going to mince words, this book is brutal.  It took months and months of working on it to crack it.  I managed to finally get my head around it by methodically using a hands-on approach.  I went chapter by chapter and implemented each new language concept the author introduced.  It took a little while, but it managed to turn the greek symbols into something a bit more concrete.\nAt this point you have quite the toolbox.  You've written a few small compilers, you've seen how language features work and how they interact with each other, you can read academic papers (if need be), and maybe you've even made a programming language of your own.  Now you can branch out to almost anywhere.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/programming-language-and-compilers-reading-list/","title":"Programming Language and Compilers Reading List"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rethinking-the-blub-paradox/":{"body":"I got a lot of great feedback on my previous post \"Rust and the Blub Paradox\", which inspired me to write a follow-up.\nIn its original formulation, the Blub Paradox is something of a tool for people to feel smug about their favorite language.  I heard a lot of feedback that it feels condescending.  I hadn't realized that in my mind the Blub Paradox had morphed from its original form into something different.\nIn this post, I'd like to break down the Blub Paradox into to what I see as its fundamental observation: that we, as programmers, can have a form of unconscious bias.  I'll call this Feature Bias so that we don't confuse it with Paul's original idea.\nThere are no universally better languages\nThere is no way to universally sort programming languages on a continuum that is monotonically increasing in awesomeness.  It's impossible.  Not only are languages too complex to have any kind of universal ranking, they are tools and as tools the value is left to the tool user.  It's like asking \"is pencil better than a paint brush?\"  It all depends on what you're doing and what you're more comfortable with.\nThe types of languages that Paul criticizes in Beating the Averages aren't universally worse than his favorite languages.  Taking one example, everyone loves to put Java down, but have you ever watched Notch (the creator of Minecraft) code in it?  He seems perfectly content to create with his tool of choice, and he's certainly capable of doing so.\nFeature Bias happens locally per feature\nRather than trying to sort languages universally, a useful version of the Blub Paradox is a local phenomenon.  It happens on a feature by feature level.\nIf a programmer accustomed to working with a feature sees a language that lacks the feature, they can also see the use cases where programmers in that other language might benefit from its use.\nIf a programmer who doesn't use a feature looks at a language with this feature, until they've spent time to understand it, they may see the feature as unnecessary.\nFeature Bias happens to most programmers, even the best\nAs a language PM at Microsoft sitting on a few programming language committees, I saw Feature Bias happen to people from junior developers to famous language designers with decades of industry experience.  The first time a developer sees a new feature, regardless of skill level, there's a chance they may experience the bias.\nTrue story: the C# feature LINQ had to 'bake' for at least a year with the design committee before enough members saw its value for it to become part of the language.  All the while the champions behind it were trying to educate and get other committee members to give it a chance.\nFeatures don't have universal value\nOnce the developer puts in the time to understand the feature, they still may not like it.  That's not the paradox/bias anymore.  They've put the time in to understand the trade-offs, and they don't feel the trade-offs are worth it.  That's a totally acceptable response.\nThe root of the bias\nTo summarize, just like other unconscious biases, this bias is pointing out something that's common for people to experience and they may not realize they're experiencing it.\nA lot of programmers I know, including myself on a good day, use an understanding of the bias as a way to train ourselves to take time with each feature and work through the knee-jerk \"oh this is crap!\" reaction.  I definitely still fall victim to it.  Just as with other biases, you have to keep working at it.\nIn seeing the responses from people, it's unfortunate that the original Blub Paradox has been used as a club to beat people with.  It makes it that much harder to see where it can be helpful.  In my experience, it can shine a light on an area that helps us become better programmers and teachers.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rethinking-the-blub-paradox/","title":"Feature Bias, or Rethinking the Blub Paradox"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/retiring/":{"body":"Yesterday was my last day at Microsoft.

What started as a \"it'd be fun to make some videos on these two hobby OSes\" has turned into a weekly video, and I'd like to keep this going.\nHow can we help?\nProbably the best thing is encouragement! Say hi on Twitter or come by the YouTube channel or Twitch stream.\nIf you have the funds and don't mind chipping in, I have Patreon, too. This will help me upgrade hardware, improve video editing, and more.\nIf you'd specifically like to help Nushell hit 1.0, I'd be happy to show you around. We've got a discord where you can join us and chat about what's happening and where to jump in. There are lots of places to help with code, docs, designs, and more. We'll also soon be posting the proposal for getting to 1.0, which will include lots of areas that you could help with.\nConclusion\nI'm both nervous and excited. Though I've planned as best I can and I live as simply as I can, it feels like taking a leap into the big blue unknown. But I'm all for following the heart and seeing what happens next.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/retiring/","title":"Retiring"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rhai-02/":{"body":"I've just updated Rhai to 0.2.  This release focuses on improving the interaction between Rhai and Rust.  The result is a cleaner, easier-to-use API.  This new API does mean some API breakages, so you'll need to update your code to work with 0.2.\nWith this release, Rhai also now has arrays as a built-in type.\nYou can upgrade/install Rhai from cargo.\nAPI improvements\nRhai 0.2 has a lot of small improvements that give it a much more natural feel in Rust.  The main three areas are function registration, getters/setter helpers, and simpler eval.\nFunction registration\nFunction registration now works through method calls on the engine, and we can infer the expected function type.  The end result is generally much cleaner.\n[Before]\n&amp;(add as fn(x: i32, y: i32)-&gt;i32).register(&amp;mut engine, \"add\");\n\n[Now]\nengine.register_fn(\"add\", add);\nGetter/setter helpers\nTo help cut down on repetition, Rhai 0.2 has a few helpers for working with getters and setters.\n[Before]\n&amp;(TestStruct::get_x as fn(&amp;mut TestStruct)-&gt;i32).register(&amp;mut engine, \"get$x\");\n&amp;(TestStruct::set_x as fn(&amp;mut TestStruct, i32)-&gt;()).register(&amp;mut engine, \"set$x\");\n\n[Now]\nengine.register_get_set(\"x\", TestStruct::get_x, TestStruct::set_x);\nSimpler eval\nEval will now take the expected return type as a type parameter, letting you cut out a few steps.  We've also moved to using &amp;str rather than String for eval inputs.\n[Before]\nif let Ok(result) = engine.eval(\"40 + 2\".to_string()).unwrap().downcast::&lt;i32&gt;() {}\n\n[Now]\nif let Ok(result) = engine.eval::&lt;i32&gt;(\"40 + 2\") {}\nNew feature: arrays\nIn addition to the API improvements, Rhai now has a built-in array type.\nvar y = [1, 2, 3]; \ny[1] = 5; \n\nprint(y[1]);\nThanks!\nThanks for the feedback on Rhai's first release.

This release brings new features, better stability, and an easier installation than the first alpha.\nSupport for new project types\nWhen a project first starts, it tends to begin life as a library or as an application.  As projects grow, sometimes they take on aspects of both, being both a library and an application that can be executed.\nWith alpha 2, we add support for this hybrid project type. Why, you might ask?\n\nEditing Cargo's source code\nWith this change we can now work on Cargo in RLS.  We're continuing to improve the experience and take on even larger codebases, but it's promising to see the RLS already able to work with real-world projects, like Cargo.\nSupport for custom derive\nRust projects that need serialisation often reach for the popular serde crate to do the work.  With alpha 2, we now support the new serde annotations that are based on the new custom derive capabilities, which is sometimes called \"macros 1.1\".\nSupport for test code\n\nEditing a test in Tokio\nWith alpha 2, you'll also be able to get intellisense for the #[test] functions code in your project, allowing you to seamlessly switch between application and test code without having to change anything in your IDE or project.  We'd like to extend this coverage more in the future.\nBetter stability\nWe've fixed dozens of issues in the RLS and related crates.  As a result, the experience is much more solid.  We continue to make stability a focus as we push towards the beta release, but we're already pleased with the progress since the first alpha.\nEasier installation\nWhen you look at the setup instructions for the RLS now, you'll see we've got it down to four steps.\n\nStandard library documentation on hover\nWe've also simplified getting access to the standard library documentation.  In one step, you can get now all the types and documentation for the standard library to your RLS install, allowing you to get the same IDE experience with the standard library that you do with your own code.\nPart of the Rust language nursery\nThe RLS, as it's matured, has proven that it's ready to take a step closer to being an official Rust project.  Recently, the Rust tools team voted to bring the RLS in the Rust language 'nursery', a set of blessed projects that are working towards becoming an officially supported part of the Rust toolchain.  We're excited to take this step and are committed to continuing to improve it towards the eventual 1.0 release.\nLooking forward\nWe're hopeful this will let more people set up the RLS and get the best experience.  In the future, we hope to transition the RLS over to the rustup tool, which should allow you to add RLS support with one easy command.  This release is a stepping stone to that vision.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-alpha-2/","title":"Rust Language Server Alpha 2 Release"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-alpha-release/":{"body":"Today, we're announcing the first alpha release of the Rust Language Server (aka RLS).  With this alpha release, this is the first time we're encouraging early adopters to try on real projects and send us feedback.  The RLS has now reached a level of maturity where it should be able to run against most Cargo-based Rust projects.\nBut what exactly is the Rust Language Server?\nIn a nutshell\nThe Rust Language Server is a way of providing editors and IDEs with a range of functionality.  Rather than leaving each editor plugin to have to parse and understand the types in your program and provide you with capabilities like refactoring, the RLS centralizes all this logic and provides it to the editor via a standard language server protocol.\nIn this alpha release, this allows editors and IDEs to share the following capabilities:\n\nauto-completion - allowing you to complete symbols and press '.' for member lists\ngoto definition - jump to the definition of a given symbol\ngoto symbol - jump to the definition of a symbol you know the name of\nfind all references - show all the locations a given symbol is referenced\nrename/refactor - rename all instances of a given symbol to a new name\ntypes on hover - get the type of a symbol\nshow errors - as the user types, get live analysis showing errors as they happen\n\nThe alpha release of the RLS has been run successfully on Linux, Mac, and Windows.\nHow to get started\nStep 0: Make sure you have a recent nightly rustc/cargo, git, python, node, and cmake installed\nStep 1: Check out the RLS:\ngit clone https://github.com/jntrnr/rls\n\nStep 2: Set up your editor (here we show VS Code plugin)\ngit clone https://github.com/jntrnr/rls_vscode.git\ncd rls_vscode\nnpm install\n\nStep 3: Set the RLS_ROOT environment variable to point to where you checked out the RLS:\nexport RLS_ROOT=/Source/rls\n\nAt this point, you can open the project in VS Code, and when you run the project, it will open a new instance of VS Code with the RLS plugin enabled.  The plugin will build RLS for you.\nNote: the initial analysis of a project can take quite a long time, as metadata is built for all the project dependencies.\nNote 2: analysis currently ignores test code, so you won't get IDE support for it.  We have a fix for this in the works.\nHow does it work\nThe current version of the RLS is built from a combination of two tools: racer and the Rust compiler.\nRacer allows us to get quick-and-dirty completions, allow you to get completion results in sub-second times.  The trade-off this makes is that the results are not as accurate.\nFor tasks that require higher accuracy, like safe refactoring or code navigation, the RLS uses the Rust compiler directly.  Because this type of analysis, while more accurate, takes longer to complete, the RLS will tell the editor when the analysis has successfully completed.\nHelp, it doesn't work!\nThe RLS is closely tied to particular versions of rustc.  If you're a rustup user, the DLLs it needs are managed by rustup.  In this case, you'll get an error like this if you run the rls by hand:\njturner-23759:rls jturner$ ~/.cargo/bin/rls \ndyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/librustc_driver-6eb85298.dylib\n  Referenced from: /Users/jturner/.cargo/bin/rls\n  Reason: image not found\nAbort trap: 6\n\nIf you see an error like this, you can run the rls by instead running the command cargo run in the rls directory.  In the future, as we improve the rls integration with the main Rust tools, this will no longer be an issue.\nWhat's next\nThe RLS is still early in its life and needs to go through a stabilization period before it's ready for 1.0.  This alpha release marks the first release in this series.\nThe next release will be a second alpha that includes another set of bugfixes and polish.  This will be followed by a beta.  The beta will be the first that will be distributed as a binary and will be much closer to final 1.0 experience in terms of ease-of-install and ease-of-use.\nI want to help\nGreat!  There are a few ways you can jump in.\nTest the RLS - use the RLS on your projects and tell us how it feels.  This will help us shake it out and make sure it's ready for production.\nContribute to RLS: - we'd like to add more refactorings, more Rust-centric code navigation (eg find all impls for a type), and possibly more advanced features like lifetime visualization and macro debugging.\nContribute an editor plugin - there are already at least six plugins that follow the Language Server Protocol that the RLS uses, each in its own state of completion.  If you have experience with one of those editors, or if you have a favorite editor you don't see on the list, you can help us by improving support.  While the RLS will continue to grow and mature, it's really the plugin where the \"rubber meets the road\".  It's the plugin that helps the developer get the most out of what the RLS provides.\nHack on the compiler - ultimately, we want to drive everything in the RLS straight from the compiler.  This means being able to have sub-second response times for interactive completions as well.  The Rust compiler team has already started a series of refactoring to make the transition to an interactive mode possible.  If you have a background in compilers, IDEs, or static analysis tools and would like to help with this work, you can contact the compiler team at #rustc on irc.mozilla.org or through the Rust compiler project on GitHub.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-alpha-release/","title":"Announcing Rust Language Server Alpha Release"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-now-in-nightly/":{"body":"We've got some good news for Rust IDE support.\nWe recently hit a milestone for the Rust Language Server, a tool that combines the power of the compiler with a fast autocompletion engine.  Up to this point, if you wanted to use it you had to build it from scratch.  The process was tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone.\nWe're happy to report you can now install RLS from rustup.  Landing as a component in rustup means a few important things.\nFirst, this will make it easier to get up and running with the RLS. You no longer have to build the RLS to use it. Getting it up and running now just takes the time to run a few rustup commands:\nrustup default nightly\nrustup update nightly\nrustup component add rls\nrustup component add rust-analysis\nrustup component add rust-src\n\nYou can find more helpful tips in the readme.\nSecond, this also makes it easier for IDE/editor plugins to automatically install the RLS and use its capabilities.  This opens up the possibility for an even smoother user experience that is driven directly by the IDE plugin.  We're looking forward to exploring this further.\nLastly, it is now easier to stay up-to-date with the RLS as it improves.  Once you install the component, it will update alongside your compiler.  All you'll need to do is run the rustup update nightly command, and the RLS and its dependencies will update with it.\nWe've also been hard at work fixing bugs and improving the experience of using the RLS so that it's more stable and accurate than before.  For larger projects, you may also notice that the RLS is a bit faster as well.\nWe're excited to get this out to more people and hear your feedback.  There's still plenty of work to do, and if you'd like to jump in and help, we'd love to have you.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-now-in-nightly/","title":"RLS now available on nightly"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-and-blub-paradox/":{"body":"A few weeks ago, I read an analysis of Rust, D, and Go by Andrei Alexandrescu.  Andrei, a respected member of the C++ community and a core developer of the D programming language, took a stab at Rust at the end of his writeup with what seems like a pretty astute observation:\n\"Reading any amount of Rust code evokes the joke \"friends don't let friends skip leg day\" and the comic imagery of men with hulky torsos resting on skinny legs. Rust puts safe, precise memory management front and center of everything. Unfortunately, that's seldom the problem domain, which means a large fraction of the thinking and coding are dedicated to essentially a clerical job\"\nHaving met Andrei and seen a few of his talks, I know that he likes to poke fun.  Still, let's take the bait.  Is his observation funny because it's a funny image or is it funny because there's an underlying truth to what he's saying?\nEDIT: thanks to all the responses to this post, I've written a follow-up on where the Blub Paradox is wrong and where it's helpful.\nEDIT #2: Wow, some people also seem to be taking this article as an attack on Andrei.  Not at all!  Like I said, I've chatted with him in person and he's very much the type that likes to say funny things, whether about himself or the wide array of programming languages.  I just took one of his quotes about Rust as a starting point and had fun with it and looked at what might be weird about Rust coming from other languages.\nBlub paradox\nWhenever I think about how useful certain language features are, I almost always come back to Paul Graham's essay \"Beating the Averages\".  In it, he observes an interesting phenomenon among programmers he calls \"the Blub Paradox\".  To recap for those who haven't heard of it, the paradox goes something like this: let's say there's a programmer using a language called Blub.  Blub falls somewhere in the middle of the programming language pack in terms of capability.  It's not the lowest, most minimal language nor is it the most powerful.\nWhen the Blub programmer looks \"down\" the spectrum of languages, they can easily see that those languages are less expressive than their preferred Blub language.  Unfortunately, when they look \"up\" the spectrum of languages, they can't tell they're looking up.  As Paul puts it:\n\"What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.\"\nWhen I read that years ago, I remember thinking \"wow, that's pretty astute.\"  Little did I know that years later it would become firmly ingrained as part of how I thought about teaching programming as a programming language PM.\nAs a programming language PM at Microsoft, I worked on TypeScript, a typed version of JavaScript.  Without fail, if I was speaking to an audience of predominantly JavaScript developers, I would get many frowns as I tried to enumerate the advantages of adding a bit of type-checking to JavaScript.  Even if it was optional.  Even if I showed half a dozen powerful advantages.  As Paul notes, it just looked \"weird\".  To a JavaScript developer, TypeScript would often just seem like a language that was equally expressive with \"hairy\" stuff thrown in.\nAs I talked to more language PMs, and I met more and more people at conferences, I learned that Paul's observation was not only accurate, it was also surprisingly universal.  Most programmers will struggle when looking at a new language they don't use.  Often, they'll have allergic reactions to features that are foreign. It takes time to work with the features enough to understand why they aren't just unnecessary ornamenation gumming up the works.\nIn short, the Blub Paradox is something that as programmers we actively need to assume we're falling into and then work to get ourselves out of.\nLet's do just that.  Let's look at a few stand-out Rust features and assume these features are weird and unnecessary.  From there, we'll see if we can work to un-Blub ourselves.\nWeird feature #1: Rust-style polymorphism\nLet's make a Rust program that uses a bit of polymorphism to print out two different structs.  I'll show you the code first, then break it down.\nuse std::fmt;\n\nstruct Foo {\n    x: i32\n}\n\nimpl fmt::Display for Foo {\n    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {\n        write!(f, \"(x: {})\", self.x)\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Bar {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32\n}\n\nimpl fmt::Display for Bar {\n    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {\n        write!(f, \"(x: {}, y: {})\", self.x, self.y)\n    }\n}\n\nfn print_me&lt;T: fmt::Display&gt;(obj : T) {\n    println!(\"Value: {}\", obj)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let foo = Foo {x: 7};\n    let bar = Bar {x: 5, y: 10};\n    print_me(foo);\n    print_me(bar);\n}\n\nWhat an eye-full!  There's polymorphism there, but it doesn't look anything like OO.  It's generic, and not only generic, but it has constraints.  And what's this impl stuff?\nLet's break it into parts.  I'm creating two structs to hold our values.  I go a step further and make sure they implement something called fmt::Display.  In C++, you might overload the &lt;&lt; operator for ostream.  The end result is similar in Rust.  After I have this in place, I can call print functions and pass these structs directly.\nWith that, we're half way through the example.\nNext, we have our print_me function.  This function is generic, and will accept anything so long as what is passed in can do fmt::Display.  Luckily, we've already said how both structs can do just that.\nThe rest is straight-forward.  We create a few structs and pass them to print_me.\nPhew... that seemed like a bit of work.  And really, that's how polymorphism starts in Rust.  It's all with generics.\nNow, let's switch to C++ for a minute.  Someone using C++, especially a beginner, might not go the generic route at first and might instead opt to use OO-style polymorphism:\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nclass Foo {\n    public:\n        int x;\n        virtual void print();\n};\n\nclass Bar: public Foo {\n    public:\n        int y;\n        virtual void print();\n};\n\nvoid Foo::print() {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"x: \" &lt;&lt; this-&gt;x &lt;&lt; '\\n';\n}\n\nvoid Bar::print() {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"x: \" &lt;&lt; this-&gt;x &lt;&lt; \" y: \" &lt;&lt; this-&gt;y &lt;&lt; '\\n';\n}\n\nvoid print(Foo foo) {\n    foo.print();\n}\n\nvoid print2(Foo &amp;foo) {\n    foo.print();\n}\n\nvoid print3(Foo *foo) {\n    foo-&gt;print();\n}\n\nint main() {\n    Bar bar;\n    bar.x = 5;\n    bar.y = 10;\n\n    print(bar);\n    print2(bar);\n    print3(&amp;bar);\n}\n\nPretty easy, right?  Okay, here's a quick quiz for you.  What does the C++ code print?\nIf you guessed wrong, don't worry.  You're in good company.\nIf you guessed right, congrats!  Now, think a minute about how much do you have to understand about C++ to know the answer.  From what I see, you need to understand the stack, how objects are copied, when they are copied, pointers, references, v-tables, and virtual dispatch. Just to do a few simple lines of OO.\nWhen I first started learning C++, I had a pretty steep hill to climb.  Luckily, my cousin is an expert C++ programmer and took me under-wing to show me the ropes.  Still, I made tons of beginner mistakes like the one above.  Why?  In part, the hill is steep because of the cognitive load of learning C++.\nSome of that cognitive load is inherent in programming a computer at a system's level.  You need to understand the stack.  You need to understand how pointers work.  What C++ adds is another layer of complexity around knowing when a value isn't fully copied and when virtual dispatch is and isn't used -- all without any warning to the user if they do something that is \"probably a bad idea(tm)\".\nThis isn't to knock on C++.  Much of Rust is based on keeping the C++ philosophy of low-level efficient abstractions intact.  In fact, you can even write code that's very similar to the Rust example.\nWhat Rust does do in this case is to separate inheritance from polymorphism and push you towards genericity from the start.  In doing so, it gets you thinking generically from day #1.  It might seem weird to separate inheritance from polymorphism if you're used to them being used together.\nThat separation gives us one of our first Blub moments: what's the advantage of separating inheritance and polymorphism?  In fact, does Rust even have inheritance?\nBelieve it or not, at least as of Rust 1.5, Rust does not allow inheritance of structs.  Instead, we can grow the functionality of structs from outside them using a feature called 'traits'.  Traits allow you a way to add methods, require methods, and retrofit datastructures for existing systems.  They're also allowed to inherit, so one trait can extend another.\nIf you poke around in the Rust, you'll also notice something else.  We don't have the same issues we had with C++.  There's no worrying about what gets lost when the function is called or how virtual dispatch works.  In Rust, we're uniform regardless of the type.  Because of this, a whole class of beginner errors vanish.\nWeird feature #2: what, no exceptions?\nWhile we're on the subject of things Rust doesn't have, its next weird feature is that it lacks exceptions.  Isn't that like going backwards?  How do we talk about errors that only occur sometimes?  How do we bubble out errors so we can handle them in one place?\nNext you'll be saying I have to learn monads.\nActually... no, just kidding, you don't need to learn monads.  Rust's exception-less programming is a lot more straight-forward.  Here's an example of what this looks like in practice.  First, examples of what the functions look like:\nimpl SystemTime {\n  /// Returns the system time corresponding to \"now\".\n  pub fn now() -&gt; SystemTime;\n\n  /// Returns an `Err` if `earlier` is later\n  pub fn duration_from_earlier(&amp;self, earlier: SystemTime) -&gt; Result&lt;Duration, SystemTimeError&gt;;\n}\n\nNotice the now function returns a SystemTime and doesn't have any error cases, while duration_from_earlier does have a Result that can be either a Duration or the error SystemTimeError.  At a glance, you know a function's success and possible failure cases.\nBut all those failure cases are bound to stack up.  Who wants to see them all over the code?  Sure, it's good to do error checking, but the point of exceptions is to be able to handle them not only locally but also to let them bubble up and handle them in one place.\nRust lets you do that, too.\nfn load_header(file: &amp;mut File) -&gt; Result&lt;Header, io::Error&gt; {\n  Ok(Header { header_block: try!(file.read_u32()) })\n}\n\nfn load_metadata(file: &amp;mut File) -&gt; Result&lt;Metadata, io::Error&gt; {\n  Ok(Metadata { metadata_block: try!(file.read_u32()) })\n}\n\nfn load_audio(file: &amp;mut File) -&gt; Result&lt;Audio, io::Error&gt; {\n  let header = try!(load_header(file));\n  let metadata = try!(load_metadata(file));\n  Ok(Audio { header: header, metadata: metadata })\n}\n\nWhile it may not look like it at first, the above example uses the \"bubbling\" style of exceptions.  The trick is in a Rust macro called try!.  What it does is pretty simple.  It will call a function for you.  If that call returns with a success value, it will hand that to you.  If it instead returns an error, try! will return from the containing function with that error.\nThe end result means that if if load_header ever has a problem when calling file.read_u32(), that Error will be returned instead.  If it is, the same thing happens in load_audio, meaning that it, too, will return the same Error.  And so on, until the calling function finally handles the error case.\nI wrote a post about try!, if you'd like to learn more.\nWeird feature #3: the borrow-checker\nYou know, it's funny.  Many people mention the borrow-checker as the first thing about Rust.  Often, they even rank it as the thing that sets Rust apart.  To Andrei, this is the \"hulky torso\" part of Rust.  To me, though, the borrow-checker is just another pass in the compiler.  Just like type-checking, it helps catch a level of bugs before they happen at runtime.  That's it.  It might seem hefty at first, but I'd argue that's just because it's different and learning to work with it grows a new muscle as a programmer, not unlike working with a new type system.\nWhat kinds of bugs does the borrow-checker catch, you ask?\nUse-after-free\nAh yes, the classic problem of freeing memory and then trying to use it later.  Quite often, this is what makes programs crash with the dreaded \"null pointer exception\".\nThere are a good handful of C++ best practices to help avoid this (using RAII, preferring references or smart pointers over raw pointers, documenting the ownership in your API docs, etc), which is likely what Andrei referred to as \"large fraction of the thinking and coding are dedicated to essentially a clerical job\".  A team of highly trained C++ programmers would see avoiding use-after-free as largely clerical because that's about what it amounts to -- so long as you obey all the best practices, never cheat, and you always only grow the team with more experts.\nInvalid iterator\nEver modify a container you're iterating over in C++ and then have a random crash later on?  I have.  If you managed to add or remove an item to the container that was enough to force memory reallocation, your iterator has become invalid.\nI don't often make this error, but I still do from time to time.\nData races\nIn Rust, data is either shared or mutable.  If it's mutable, it can't be shared, so you don't risk mutating from two threads in a race.  If it's shared, you can't mutate, so you can read to your heart's content from multiple threads.\nIf you're coming from C++, or any other language with a set of good parallel libraries, this is going to feel overly strict to say the least.  Luckily, this isn't the whole story, but instead the general basis that gives you a simple set of rules to build more abstractions on.  The rest of the story is still young and forming.  There are a growing number of libraries focused on concurrency that you can follow if you're interested to learn more.\nTracking ownership\nThis may seem a bit redundant, but it's actually something that C++ struggles with.  I alluded earlier to \"documenting the ownership in your API docs\".  The problem is that this information is in a comment rather than the code itself.\nHere's a scenario: you're in C++ and you need to call a library that you didn't write.  Let's say it's a C-based library and takes a raw pointer.  Will it delete what you passed in?  Will it take ownership of it and put it into one of its data structures?  Maybe you're calling into a scripting engine like Ruby.  Then who owns it?\nRather than reading through docs, Rust lets you verify that your assumptions match reality when it tracks how you are using the API with the borrow-checker.\nAnd more\nBorrow checking helps other classes of errors.  For example, it helps improve local reasoning when you're writing a function because you can safely assume that any mutable values coming in are disjoint and won't interact with each other when you change them.\nThis incidentally also opens the door for additional optimizations because the compiler can ensure that values can never be both aliased and mutable, something that is difficult to do in C-based languages with alias analysis.\nThere's more good info about the borrow checker and classes of errors it prevents in \"You can't spell trust without Rust\" if you're interested.\nWeird feature #4: rules are meant to be broken\nI'd argue that one of Rust's strongest suits is that it's pragmatic.  Most of Rust's stringent checks can be circumvented using features like unsafe, mem::transmute, and more.  That's right, don't like the borrow-checker for your use case?  No problem, turn it off.\nRust is made to be able to express anything you can do in a C-like systems language.  The advantage of Rust is that it's much easier to start with safe defaults that can be pushed out of the way when needed.  It's much more difficult to build safety on top of unsafe language features.\nWhile Rust lets you pick and choose, it biases towards not letting you shoot your foot off. \nDid Rust miss leg day?\nSpeaking of feet, did Rust miss leg day after all?  Is it lopsided?  Has it been focused on the wrong things?\nRust is getting stronger, and luckily it has enough safeguards in place to know how to go into the squat without pulling its back.  This part can't be understated.  The philosophy behind Rust is one of having good fundamentals.  As long as the good fundamentals are there, the language can grow on that foundation.\nBut you don't have to take my word on it.  Like any fix for the Blub Paradox, it comes down to programmers picking up Rust and seeing if the kinds of capabilities Rust gives them allows them to express themselves efficiently and in a way that avoids classes of bugs that distract from the problem at hand.\nIt's natural to think that some features are ornamental when you're first coming to them.  Time and exposure are the real test.\nSpecial thanks to Yehuda Katz and Jason Turner for reviewing this post and sending me their feedback\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-and-blub-paradox/","title":"Rust and the Blub Paradox"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-in-windows/":{"body":"As a Rust user, I was discouraged by not having all the good tips for using Rust in Windows in one place.  This is an attempt to just that.  If you have more tips tweet them to @jntrnr, and I'll try to add them here.\nGetting started\nStep 1: Install Visual Studio Community edition\nMy recommendation for working with Rust in Windows is to first get Visual Studio 2017 Community installed.  Edit: Make sure you check the boxes to install C++ support when you instal Visual Studio, this provides the linker. The Rust compiler will use the linker that VS provides to translate our Rust code all the way to being an application.  Having VS installed pays off in more ways than one, as we'll see later.\nStep 2: Install rustup\nThe Rust toolchain (including the compiler and the cargo build tool) are managed by a tool called rustup.  This is the easiest way get going with Rust.  It also has a few advantages, like allowing you to more easily switch the style of compiler (stable/beta/nightly) as well as building for other targets, like embedded systems.\nOnce Visual Studio is installed, rustup will detect it and let us install the compiler that works with the VS toolchain.  Rustup on the initial install will let you pick the compiler, and you can select working with nightly or release.  What you choose is up to you.  Nightly gives you access to new features but hasn't been tested as thoroughly as the stable release compiler.\nWhether you choose Nightly or Stable, you'll have commands available to you at the terminal.  You won't need a separate shell to get to them.  The commands 'rustc' and 'cargo' are the Rust compiler and Rust package manager respectively. \nStep 3: Make sure everything is working\nIn a source directory, you can test if Rust has been installed correctly by creating a simple project, compiling it, and running it.\ncargo new hello_world --bin\ncd hello_world\ncargo run (or \"cargo build\" followed by \"cargo run\")\n\nYou can find out lots of helpful general getting started tips in the Rust documentation.\nWriting Rust Code in Windows\nCurrently, IDE support for Rust is still in its infancy.  If you don't need fully intellisense-style IDE experience, pretty much all editors now have basic Rust support.  Pick your favorite one, install their Rust plugin or syntax highlighter, and you're good to go.  Many of these plugins come with support for a project called 'racer', which provides an autocompletion.  Visual Studio users may be interested in Visual Rust.\nFor the more daring, there's a project called the Rust Language Server, which is based on the Language Server Protocol developed for VS Code and now part of a growing number of editors and IDEs.\nYou can find steps for how to set up the RLS and use it with VS Code on its readme.  That said, the RLS is still pre-beta quality as of the writing of this post, so please exercise caution if you go this route.\nDebugging with Visual Studio\nEarlier we installed Visual Studio.  It seems a waste to have this nice VS install sitting around and not getting more benefit from it it.  Let's use it for debugging.\nBefore we do some debugging, there are two steps we'll want to do beforehand:\nStep 1: Install rust-src\nWhen we're debugging, VS will sometimes complain because it can't find the source code to the standard libs.  We can remove this announce by installing the rust-src, and helping VS find the source it's looking for (this is also a helpful step for racer support)\nrustup component add rust-src\n\nThis will let you find the source to the standard libs when you're debugging.  After the command is run, it will be put in your .multirust directory.  For me that directory is:\nC:\\Users\\Jonathan Turner\\.multirust\\toolchains\\nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\\lib\\rustlib\\src\\rust\\src\n\nWhen Visual Studio asks you for a file from the standard library source, this should give you a good place to start looking for it.\nStep 2: Add natvis for Rust\nRust has its own common structs, like String and Vec, that Visual Studio won't understand by default currently.  To be able to view these data structures, we use native visualisation or .natvis files.  Rustup will helpfully make them available for us, we just have to copy them into our personal directory.  For me, the .natvis files are in:\nC:\\Users\\Jonathan Turner\\.multirust\\toolchains\\nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\\lib\\rustlib\\src\\rust\\src\\etc\\natvis\n\nNOTE: you may need to install the nightly toolchain to have this directory.  You don't need to use the nightly compiler as your main compiler, though, to take advantage of them.\nI copy these files into:\nC:\\Users\\Jonathan Turner\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2017\\Visualizers\n\nIf you don't have a Visualizers directory, go ahead and create it and then copy the files into it.  Once you start up VS, it should pick them up and give you a little better view of your Rust data.\nWith that, debugging a Rust app works very similar to debugging other apps.  There are a few steps you need to do:\n\nCompile your projects with debug info.  The easiest way is to build using cargo build and NOT cargo build --release.\nRun your application\nAttach the VS debugger using the 'Attach...' feature.  You should be able to find your application in the list.  Once you attach, you can hit pause, set breakpoints, and step as normal.\n\nDebugging with VSCode and MSVC\nYou can also setup vscode as your development and debugging platform.  There are some good tips on how to do this in this blog post.\nConclusion\nThere is still plenty of room for improvement, but already there's enough here that we can write, build, and debug Rust applications without too much fuss.  The Rust teams are working to continue to improve the experience of developing in Windows on Rust, but it's encouraging to see the progress and where it could go in the future.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-in-windows/","title":"Using Rust in Windows"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-quickie-matching-strings/":{"body":"In case you find yourself trying to match a String (perhaps as part of an Option or Result), here's a little trick.\nAs a concrete example, let's say you're working with commandline args and want to do different things if it's there and equal to a special value (like \"-\"), if it's any other filename, or if it's not there.\nmatch args().nth(1) {\n    Some(\"-\")     =&gt; println!(\"Input is stdin\"),\n    Some(ref x)   =&gt; println!(\"Open file: {}\", x),\n    None          =&gt; println!(\"Open default file /foo/bar\")\n}\n\nWhen you try to compile this, you get:\nerror: mismatched types:\n expected `collections::string::String`,\n    found `&amp;'static str`\n(expected struct `collections::string::String`,\n    found &amp;-ptr) [E0308]\n\nBummer! At least on the surface, it looks like we don't have an easy way to use a string constant like \"-\" in our pattern match when what we're matching against a String.\nLuckily, Rust pattern matching has a way to help us.  We can approximate the above by using match guards.  Match guards allow us to put an additional if expression on the pattern.\nmatch args().nth(1) {\n    Some(ref x) if x == \"-\" =&gt; println!(\"Input is stdin\"),\n    Some(ref x) =&gt; println!(\"Open file: {}\", x),\n    None        =&gt; println!(\"Open default file /foo/bar\")\n}\n\nMatch guards give you an extra bit of \"juice\" to express your logic.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-quickie-matching-strings/","title":"Rust quickie - matching Strings"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust2018-and-data/":{"body":"Here's my #rust2018 post to add to the batch.\nThe past few years, I've been lucky to be part of the Rust community survey process.  In 2016, this data helped show the need to improve usability.  We had good foundations, but they were too hard to get at.  In 2017, we saw a renewed need to reach out to companies, to improve documentation, and a continued importance of pushing to making Rust more usable.\nThese surveys were a key part of seeing big issues, but it got me thinking.  Are there better ways to get and use data?  Can we see Rust more clearly -- for what we do well and where we need to improve -- in the future?\nWhen you do performance tuning, you benchmark and run perf profilers to get at the root of the problem.  What if we did the equivalent for Rust as a whole?\nWe already measure through the surveys.  The problem is, we can only really measure once or twice a year.  This results in waiting long periods of time to see if we successfully addressed an issue.  The delay may mean we don't catch new issues in time or we may fix a problem only to find out we didn't address the underlying cause.\nGetting better data, sooner\nWhat if we had a way to have better data sooner?  There are a few ways we could do this.\nSmaller surveys\nThe first thing we could do is put out smaller surveys and use them as a quick check-in.  They might target specific features in a \"did this change solve your issue?\" way.  We do a bit of this in the RFC process already.  People who know about a particular RFC can jump in and comment on whether or not it the approach works for them.\nWhile we want to continue using RFCs for this feedback, we could extend what we do here.  For example, a blog post could talk about a group of RFCs working together to address one core problem. We could have a quick survey as part of the post to gather feedback on whether the combination of changes does what we hoped.\nThis is still pretty manual, though, and is focused developers actively reading RFCs and blogs and volunteering their time, which may be limited.  Are there ways we can get more people involved across a wider range of changes?\nUsability studies\nThere's another avenue we could explore: usability studies.  Work on software development in the past has shown there's naturally a distance between what people think they spend the most time on and what they actually do spend the most time on.  Self-reporting often misses these insights.\nWhen you actually watch someone working, issues with usability become more obvious.\nWith the rise of coding streams, we already have some usability data already.  Perhaps there is a way to leverage the same tools so that we can perform studies remotely.  The end result of these could more directly answer how workflows improve, and give us a clearer insight into both the Rust learning process and how more experienced Rust users use Rust in their work.\nOpt-in statistics\nWhat if Rust developers could opt-in to some statistics gathered from the tools themselves?  This would let Rust developers help the Rust project as part of their everyday work.\nSo it's clear, let me state I'm a strong privacy advocate.  I have no desire to read people's private source code, to try to \"guess\" what they're doing, or anything remotely like that.  Instead, here are some ideas we could be looking at that are helpful while not being invasive:\n\nWhat error messages are people hitting?  How often?\nRoughly how much time is spent working in Rust?\nHow long are build times compared to the lines of code?  How much is incremental compilation helping?\nRoughly how much are particular language features being used?\n\nI believe there's a way to we can gather data like this in a way that is both opt-in and preserves the privacy of the developer.\nTransparency\nAn important aspect of \"better data, sooner\" is transparency.\nIf we're careful, we can and should make the data we gather public.  It gives contributors a window into the Rust world in more depth than we've previously had.\nImagine a live \"board\" where you could go and see Rust being used in real time, seeing what errors are occuring the most or if the latest fixes to nightly improved build times in the wild.  This data could help not only people putting code in the compiler, but also folks writing RFCs, documentation, and more.\nMeasure twice, cut once\nWhen I was growing up, my dad would do various woodworking projects around the house.  When I'd help, he would remind me to \"measure twice, cut once\".  You didn't want to waste the effort it took to cut the wood if you couldn't use the result.\nWe can take a similar attitude for Rust in 2018.  There are a lot of things we could do.  Lots of initiatives.  Lots of projects.  Can we come up with ways to measure twice before we invest the time?  I think we can, and Rust will be better for it.\nHere's to a happy, successful Rust in 2018!\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust2018-and-data/","title":"Improving how we improve Rust in 2018"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/scripting-languages-of-the-future/":{"body":"I've been thinking recently about what the future for scripting languages could look like. We've had a good run with Python, JavaScript, and Ruby for the last few decades. I wondered, what might the next few decades look like.\nWhat is the scripting language of the future? How should it work? Here are some thoughts.\nScalability\nWorking on TypeScript, something that became a constant refrain for us was that \"TypeScript is JavaScript that scales\".\nI might be a bit biased, but this is actually incredibly valuable. If your team invests time into writing an app in a scripting language, there shouldn't be an impedance mismatch that grows as the app gets larger. For JavaScript, we'd watch teams grow their apps only to have to increase testing and onboarding training to prevent bugs from creeping in. And yet, they still crept in.\nTypeScript gave tools a chances to catch these errors earlier, even in well-tested codebases. Back in 2012, this was something viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism, and today over third of professional developers use TypeScript.\nWhat TypeScript showed is that you could join together the idea of a flexible lightweight (and optional!) type system onto an existing programming language, and do so successfully.\nThe question then is - what if you created a programming language from the start to have this kind of support? No need for transpilers, while also having stronger engine integration and maybe even better runtime errors?\nIt's a tempting mix of possibilities and one well worth being a part of the scripting language of the future.\nTune-ability\nI've known multiple people who were hired to rewrite a piece of infrastructure originally written in a scripting language. Just like scripts need to be able to scale to larger sizes, scripts need to be tune-able. The choice to go dynamic shouldn't be a hard stop on real performance tuning and maintenance.\nThe work on numpy, scipy, pandas and others for Python is one possible blueprint. Instead of having to leave your language of choice, powerful libraries build up around it to support the high performance needs of different disciplines.\nThere will likely be some resistance to this point, as there seems to be just an inevitable trade-off between performance and the flexibility that a scripting language provides. In all honesty, this feels like an older, and perhaps outdated, way of looking at this trade-off.\nFor years, JavaScript developers have looked to techniques like monomorphism to tune the performance of JavaScript code. They're structuring code in a way that's more \"VM friendly\". The VM has to do less work to understand the types and structures in the code, and as a result guesses correctly the first time when doing runtime code generation.\nThe ability to tune code can come from other sources, too. Type decorations is one tempting direction to mention, though so far no established languages (that I know of) have used the technique to general type hints to speed up code. Unless type hints are used across hot paths, and with a sound type system, the transformations risks actually slowing performance.\nThere is, however, a large exception. Dataframe systems like pandas structure operations across arrays of known types. While the setup code is all in Python, the code that actually runs is happily in systems-level tuned native libraries. In a way, Python is merely orchestrating these operations.\nFuture languages could take advantage of this pattern in other ways. The associated standard libraries of these scripting languages could encourage more orchestration and less manual processing in the language itself.\nEasy parallelism\nOn a related point to the one above: future languages need easy parallelism. By now, we've heard it a million times. The \"free lunch is over\", tomorrow's CPUs will have a zillion cores and will run at 1hz. Okay, maybe not quite that bad, but still the writing is very clearly on the wall and very much already happening. It's not far-fetched to imagine that today's 8-16 core machines over the next few decades grow to be dozens or even hundreds of cores. Any language that hopes to have a strong footing, even scripting languages, need to be able to handle this.\nThis isn't without its own challenges. As has been quotes a few times recently, Matz - the creator of Ruby - famously said \"I regret adding threads\". Having now used a lot of different kinds of parallelism systems in a lot of languages, I can easily see why. Traditional threading, and things like it, honestly feel like goto to me. Just like goto, it's easy to write code that's hard to read and, over time, hard to maintain.\nLuckily, traditional threads aren't the only game in town. Work-stealing task pools like popular libraries in Rust use are very fast and can be built to work with other abstractions like parallel iteration and reduction operations.\nMaking abstractions like this part of the language gives more opportunity to use more of the machine across all scripts written in that language. All this without, we hope, running afoul of the design choices that make language creators mourn years later.\nIDE support\nThis might sound completely alien to some folks, but the future for scripting languages includes strong IDE support. Gone are the days of most scripting being written in a simple text editor. Today, more than 86% of JavaScript is developed in an IDE.\nFuture languages are competing against established languages which have tooling and IDE support polished over many years. Any new language that wants to compete against that will have to swing for the fences.\nAt a minimum, support for the language server protocol these days in a must. Its broad support across editors gives languages much more leverage than ever before to get in front of developers.\nLooking ahead\nThere's definitely a large space to explore for scripting languages of the future. The points I list above are important, as are additional points that we'll learn as we go. Perhaps we'll be able to bring the performance that more modern JS engines enjoy to a broader range of languages through an effort similar to what LLVM did for lower-level languages.\nI, for one, am looking forward to this future and what future languages it will bring.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/scripting-languages-of-the-future/","title":"Scripting languages of the future"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/snapshot-of-rust-popularity/":{"body":"Talking about a language's popularity is traditionally a tricky topic. How do you measure popularity? How do you compare one language to another when they're focused on different styles and different audiences?  So, rather than having one or two charts, I'm going to look at a number of \"slices\" into Rust's growth to see it front different angles.\nThere are also many ways we could measure popularity. For example, looking at the growth of StackOverflow, internal forums, Twitter traffic, Google Trends, or the various language popularity reports.  Each of these measures has its own strengths and trade-offs.\nFor our purposes in this post, we're going to focus on a set of data points that should help show growth of usage rather than growth of buzz (that is, the amount people talking are about Rust). If people are using a language to do real work, that's the best indicator of a language's success.\nThe first of place we'll look for Rust usage is in open source, and with that, let's look at GitHub.\nGrowth on GitHub\nGitHub offers a few ways to measure how well a particular language is growing.  GitHub itself uses the number of pull requests in a given language, which it uses in the GitHub Octoverse.\nIf we were to run this query for 2018 so far, the top fifteen languages (by number of PRs) would be:\n\nJavaScript: 1736476\nPython: 804790\nJava: 703649\nRuby: 560430\nPHP: 359040\nC++: 319324\nTypeScript: 311229\nGo: 258131\nC#: 246513\nCSS: 236795\nShell: 168301\nC: 160889\nSwift: 67664\nScala: 67188\nRust: 52936\n\nRust comes in at 15th place as part of the group of Swift/Scala/Rust.  This is pretty good company to be in. All of the languages on this list are known for doing heavy lifting in real applications, rather than being hobby or boutique languages.\nBeing 15th is also significant because, if the Octoverse were held today, Rust would make their top languages list for the first time.\nMoving on, one gotcha of focusing on PRs is that it lets a relatively small number of highly successful projects skew the results. The popularity of the projects drives high numbers of PRs, and as a result the language looks far better.  To compensate for this, let's also look at \"active projects\". For our purposes, let's define \"active projects\" as the number of projects that a) are larger than a \"hello world\", b) have at least 1 star, and c) have been worked on in the last 30 days:\n\nJavaScript: 56437\nPython: 37554\nJava: 27912\nC++: 16787\nPHP: 16451\nShell: 12245\nC#: 11503\nC: 10662\nGo: 8816\nCSS: 8781\nTypeScript: 8447\nRuby: 7518\nSwift: 3828\nObjective-C: 3054\nRust: 2604\nKotlin: 2343\nScala: 2072\n\nAnother respectable showing for Rust. Again, we see it as part of the languages for doing serious work.\nThe GitHub numbers tell one story, but do we see the same story if we look in other places? With this kind of popularity, we'd expect to see visible use of Rust in industry.\nRust's Commercial Users\nRust has seen a surprising amount of growth in commercial usage over the past year alone. Here's a partial list of names people may know:\nAmazon - Building tools in Rust.\nAtlassian (makers of Jira) - Using Rust in the backend.\nDropbox - Using Rust in both the frontend and backend.\nFacebook - Tools for source control.\nGoogle - As part of the Fuchsia project.\nMicrosoft - Using Rust in part of their new Azure IoT work.\nnpm - Using Rust in some of the npm core services.\nRed Hat - Creating a new storage system\nReddit - Using Rust in its comment processing\nTwitter - As part of the build team support for Twitter.\nYou can see even more on the Friends of Rust that include other familiar names like Baidu, Wire, Mozilla, Samsung, Cloudflare, Chef, Canonical, and more.\nAcross the industry, software companies are beginning to adopt Rust at some level in their organization.  As expected, these may be tentative at first, focusing on Rust for build tools, for backend processing, or targeting a specific platform like IoT.  Early adopters like Dropbox and Canonical have now grown beyond initial investments to using Rust in an increasing amount of their codebase.\nAll told, it's still early days for Rust. Large companies take time to try new technology before they adopt it more broadly. We're seeing Rust in that part of the adoption curve, and it's doing well here.  Languages -- like Go and TypeScript -- that saw explosive growth in recent years also saw similar patterns at this part of their lifecycle.\nBecause of Rust's closeness with C++, we should also look at industries that are traditionally strongly populated by C++ developers. One such industry is game development.\nZooming into Games\nDespite the game industry's use of established development technologies, Rust is beginning to make in-roads with game developers.  Here's a list of usage of Rust in some familiar names among game developers:\nChucklefish Games - Using Rust in multiple upcoming games.\nElectronic Arts - Using Rust in SEED.\nFrostbite Engine - Using Rust in backend processing.\nReady at Dawn Studios - All new development will be in Rust. \nUnity - Using Rust in data engineering.\nWe're also seeing other indie developers beginning to use it for their titles. \nJust as we saw in the \"big name\" usage, we see a similar pattern with game developers. Initial usage is targeted, perhaps at backend or data-focused projects. After this, there's a path to developing core technology, and even whole games, in Rust.\nJobs\nWhen we ran the 2017 Rust survey, one of the big themes that came up for people not using Rust was around their companies not using it. The jobs just weren't there.\nIn 2018, with a growing numbers of companies and studios using Rust, has this situation improved?\nIn short, yes, though there's still a lot of room to grow. A quick look at LinkedIn's job list shows a number of Rust opportunities from the likes of Amazon as well as a number of companies involved in blockchain, security, science/healthcare, and more. Still, when compared to the volume of job offerings for languages like Go or TypeScript, there's still a gap in terms of availability.\nLet's move on from Rust's use in companies to look at the growth of the community that supports Rust.\nCommunity and Governance\nIn times past, a language could survive on being used solely for commercial development. These days, however, a language's community forms its foundation. It offers a way to ramp up new users, support new projects, and set the tone for the project going forward.\n\nRust meetups now total over 130 around the world\nThe in-person piece of the Rust community, the Rust meetups, have seen 30% growth in the last nine months and now total over 130 around the world.  We've likewise seen steady growth in the number of conferences that users can attend for more training and networking.\nWe've also seen some impressive growth in indicators of the online community as well since the last time I reported on them. For example, the Rust reddit recently passed 40k users (up from the 29k of nine months ago), the GitHub repo is nearly at 30k stars (up from 24k), and the official Rust twitter has over 31k followers (up from 24k).\nThis enthusiasm has also translated into the teams that govern Rust itself. Combined, the governing teams have doubled in size in the last 9 months to over 100 positions across the various teams. The scope has also grown in tandem, with new teams that cover infrastructure, developer experiences, and dependency management.\nConclusion\nThese are just some data points about Rust's use in industry and in the software development community. It's difficult to get a complete picture, and even more difficult to predict what will come next. That said, it does seem to shine a promising ray of light on where Rust is today.\nWhere will Rust go tomorrow?  That is anyone's guess. I, for one, will certainly be watching and cheering it along. \n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/snapshot-of-rust-popularity/","title":"A Snapshot of Rust's Popularity in July 2018"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/starting-the-next-thing/":{"body":"It's that time again! July 31st will be my last day at Mozilla. \nEven though I was only at Mozilla for just under two and a half years, I had the good fortune to work on some pretty awesome projects.\nI joined the Rust team and worked with Niko Matsakis and Aaron Turon on where Rust could grow, building on my experience coming from TypeScript. We learned a ton from each other, and I'm really grateful for all those conversations and the close friendship that resulted. I also got to roll up my sleeves and write some code. The first project was to redesign the Rust error messages with Niko. The next was to create the Rust Language Server with Nick Cameron. Both have grown a life of their own, and it's been awesome to see!\nI was also lucky to help Jack Moffitt out with the Servo project. Under his guidance, it produced loads of good code and good ideas. These made their way into Firefox and into the Firefox Reality work. Learning from Jack and connecting with the Firefox org (and some of the awesome Firefox managers) was a treat.\nFinally, my last seven months have been helping create and run the Developer Technology team at Mozilla, a melding of the Rust and WebAssembly efforts under one umbrella. This allowed even closer collaboration between the two projects and has already resulted in lots of cool new technology, tools, and coding practices. I'm excited to watch what they'll be able to come up with next.\nAnd speaking of \"next\", what's next for me?  I'm moving on to create a new company.  I don't have a ton of details to share, yet, but I hope to do so in the coming months as the ideas and technology start to come together.  \"Will it use Rust?\" I can already hear many of you asking.  Most assuredly.  If there's a better solution for efficient, write-once-and-don't-worry-about-it software development, I've yet to find it. \nThank you, Mozilla!

For the last five months, I've been a proud owner of the Alienware Alpha, one of the three Steam Machine types now available.  Knowing what could be possible, I've been curiously awaiting the official launch.\nThe plan\nValve's motivation for creating the Steam Machine seems pretty straight forward: move to the TV and compete more directly with game consoles.  Currently, that space is shared by the big three: Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.  Why not make that the big four instead, with Valve in the mix?\nTo get there, Valve has started with three initial devices.\n\nThe Steam Controller is a gamepad with two round touchpads and a set of traditional gamepad buttons.  It can be configured to work as a normal gamepad for games with gamepad support.  Alternatively, the touchpads can be used just as touchpads to play games that work with a mouse instead of gamepad.\n\nThe Steam Link is something of a gaming bridge between the PC and your TV, allowing you to stream games from your PC over to your TV.  At around $50, it's pretty inexpensive.\n\nAlienware Steam Machine\nLastly, the Steam Machine.  The Steam Machine itself isn't actually a thing.  Rather, it's a PC specification that hardware vendors can build to.  Out of the gate, three hardware vendors have already produced a Steam Machine: Alienware (pictured above), Zotac, and Syber.  Steam Machines also come with a new operating system called SteamOS, a form of Linux that's been optimized for gaming.\nThe right plan?\nNow that we know the plan, is that plan the right plan?  Specifically, does the Steam Machine have a home?\nIt's clear to me that a device like the Steam Machine has value in the market.  It's smaller than a gaming console, more flexible, and just as powerful.  I've spent countless hours gaming, reading news, watching movies, and even programming on mine.  I've even stopped using my Playstation 4, opting instead to do all my gaming on the Alpha.\nBut as I look at the Steam Machine release this week, I have some concerns.\nConcern 1: No flagship Steam Machine\nThe console market is notorious for razor-thin margins on release hardware. Traditionally, consoles are often sold as loss leaders in their early years.  Meaning, they are sold below the manufacturing costs.  The thought here is the licensing profits from the games bought by initial adopters will help offset the loss.  Once the console becomes embedded in the market, manufacturing improves, and over many, many small iterations, the console itself becomes cheap enough to make a profit.\nConsoles are always, with rare exception, first-party.  This means that the company who built the software stack that the games run on is also the company who owns and sells the hardware.  Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, and even previous game vendors like Atari and Sega, all made first-party consoles.\nRather than being first-party, Valve has opted for an approach that's closer to non-console markets like phones: third-party hardware.  Early software plays like Microsoft with MS-DOS and Windows, and more recent ones like Google's Android platform are some examples here.  The gist is that the standard platform works against a standard hardware spec. It doesn't really matter who the vendor of the hardware is, so long as it matches the spec.\nThat might look good on paper for Valve.  Since they're new into the hardware game, why not let the vendors who know what they're doing do it?\nIt's still a risky play, and, I'd argue, one that's potentially riskier than partnering with one vendor to create a Steam-branded first-party machine.  Some reasons why:\nThird-party vendors can't afford to sell loss leader machines.  This means the machines will necessarily be lower-powered than they could be.  This narrows the performance per $ gap between this batch of Steam Machines and established consoles like Playstation 4 and Xbox One.  Which, in turn, hits customers in the wallet.  While the Steam Machines are cool pieces of technology, they are also spendy pieces of technology.  For example, the Zotac machine is $900 at the time of writing.  At that price, I could buy 3 WiiUs -or- an Xbox One and a Playstation 4, with money left over for games.\nThird-party purchase experience is going to be whatever that vendor makes available.  For example, this morning when looking at the new Alienware machine I got website errors on the Dell.com site.  Of course, some of this will get better over time, but it's difficult to see how both a higher price tag and a worse purchasing experience is going to help the Steam Machine brand.\nAs an aside, you might think that being third-party would help you create the Steam Machine of your dreams, but as of the time of this writing, you can't even configure an Alienware machine to use SSD.  For a gaming machine.  No SSD.  What?  If you're like me, that's the first thing you'll want to upgrade.  I asked the Alienware rep over Twitter about it and got:\n\nAgain, likely something that will be fixed in time, but not the best initial experience and one that will turn-off some gamers from the Steam Machine idea.\nLastly, Valve's Steam brand is already better than the third-party vendor brands.  Steam is the major name in PC gaming today.  Period.  Who is Zotac or Syber?  I honestly have never heard of them.  Why play second fiddle to brands that aren't as strong as your own?\nConcern 2: SteamOS\nThe motivations here also seem straightforward: Valve gets to create a platform that a) they control and can tweak to their hearts content, b) supports a standard set of APIs that other vendors can leverage and is possibly less of a moving target than the competing APIs, and c) is free.\nWith c), Valve helps ensure that vendors can cut costs and deliver less-expensive Steam Machines.  But the whole play here is very confusing.\nRemember that a Steam Machine is a whole PC.  Unlike a game console like Playstation 4, these guys can be a full Windows 10 machine if you install Windows on them.  And Windows already runs Steam.  So, in fact, a Steam Machine with SteamOS is actually a less powerful experience than taking SteamOS off and putting Windows in its place.\nAs for the advantages, again it seems like Valve is trying to take a page from the Android playbook.\nUnfortunately, the current market is decidedly different than the market Android found itself in.  With the release of the iPhone, and its rise in the smartphone market, you had a gap created with a lot of phone vendors wanting an iPhone-like experience without an easy way to get it.  By creating a comparable work-alike, many vendors could sign up and build out the Android ecosystem.  Is SteamOS entering a market of hardware vendors looking to enter the game console market?  Having only one major PC brand, Dell, signing on to ship hardware with SteamOS is an indicator this may not be the case.\nLikewise, are game developers scrambling to get onto SteamOS?  Guessing by the size of the game lists, SteamOS has about a fifth the number of titles available for Steam on Windows.  That, by itself, is actually pretty impressive.  But, consoles really live and die on the titles themselves.  Let's do a quick rundown of my favorite kind of game, RPGs:\n\nWitcher III: no\nFinal Fantasy XIV - A Realm Reborn: no\nDark Souls II: no\n\nIn fact, I struggled to find triple-A RPGs from the last few years that run on SteamOS.  What's telling is that all three are available on Windows as well on consoles, where they use gamepad support.  In theory, this should be a solid group of games to show off your powerful new platform.\nIn fact, Fallout 4, which was also released this week, does not have SteamOS support.  Likely to be one of the biggest games of the year, and it won't run on Valve's newly-shipping machines.\nI suspect that the tech-savvy buyers will do exactly what I did when I got my machine: take out the hard drive, put in an SSD, and install Windows. \nConcern 3: Partnerships, or lack thereof\nConcerns 1 &amp; 2 above could be summarized as \"Steam Machine lacks partnerships\".  The more high profile hardware companies competing to create the best Steam Machine, the better the end result.  The more high profile game companies making games for the Steam Machine, the more SteamOS feels like an established platform like Playstation 4 and Xbox One.\nPartnerships are a catch-22.  It's difficult to get them without first showing that your platform is a big enough draw to support the investment it takes to port a game or build a machine.  Without the partnerships, the platform never grows to that size.\nRoad ahead\nIt's too early to say whether or not Valve will be successful.  This release of the Steam Machine is muddied by a confusing story and a lack of partnerships, but there is still time to improve the experience.  When Steam first came out, it had few games and many thought it was a weak idea. It, of course, grew to the giant it is today.\nLike building a game distribution mechanism like Steam, a game console is also a long play.  It takes years and lots of cash to build up a brand in the console market.  Microsoft famously rumored to have spent north of a billion dollars to establish the first Xbox.  From outward appearances, Valve is trying to compete with the console on a fraction of that budget.\nWill Valve and its partners have the patience to build their own niche?  Time will tell.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/steam-machines/","title":"Steam Machines enter the market"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/telling-truth-in-code-function/":{"body":"When people talk about reasons to use a type system, there are always a couple usual suspects: error checking, documentation, and if you're an IDE person like me, tooling/editor tricks that use type information, like auto-complete.\nBut there's another aspect to the types of function signatures that's related to documentation but is perhaps stands on its own: transparency.\nWhat is transparency?\nFor this post, transparency helps us answer a few questions:\n\nWhat does this function require?\nWhat does this function return?\nWhat is this function going to do with what I give it?\n\nCan it modify it?\nCan it delete it?\n\n\nCan this function fail?  If so, how?\nDoes this function do anything besides use its value?\n\nie) does this function \"change the world\" in some way?\n\n\n\nWhy is transparency important?\nA way most of us can relate to transparency is in the relationships you have in your life.  When you're not transparent with another person -- keeping all of your thoughts to yourself, never saying when you're angry, etc -- how does the other person ever know how to react to you? \nTransparency in code works similarly.  When a function is transparent, you know what you need to do when the function is called, and you know how to react when the function is called.  Let's look at a few examples.  In each example, we're going to talk about a function that takes in an employee name and writes that name to a file. \nExamples\nPython\ndef writeToFile(name):\n    # write out to the file\n\nWe'll start with the simplest form of transparency: minimal transparency.  Looking at what we have it's tempting to say we don't know anything at all, but that's not quite true.  We do know the function name and that it takes a single parameter.\nThings we don't know:\n\nWhat kind of thing does it take?\nCan it modify the thing we give it?\nCan it delete what we give it?\nDoes it return anything?\nDoes it throw any exceptions?\nDoes it have any permanent effect on our system\n\neg) send files over the network, add to a database, launch the missiles?\n\n\n\nWithout this knowledge, we resort to aggressively testing, commenting, and using naming and coding conventions to get the idea across.\nC\nint writeToFile(char *name) { \n    /* write out to the file */\n}\n\nMoving into C, we start to see a bit more information popping out.  We know that it takes in a char* for the name.  Since this also isn't const, we know that it's allowed to change the contents of the string we pass in.  We also know it returns an int, likely for error codes.\nWe are starting to see into what the function can do, but there's still quite a bit we don't know:\n\nCan this function change our system?\nCan the name value be deleted? \nCan the function raise a signal (a C-flavored way of exceptions/events)?\nAnd what about those error codes?\n\nHow do we know the int is for error codes, and not returning the length of data written? \nIf it is for error codes, how do we know which ones it supports?\n\n\n\nWe've improved some, but we still lean heavily on conventions, code comments, and testing to ensure that this function behaves correctly.  As an aside: one interesting point of C is that it doesn't have exceptions, like many languages, so you're almost encouraged to have a more value-based programming style, though it lacks many common features that help fill out the value-based story (pattern matching, algebraic data types, etc).\nRust\nfn writeToFile (name: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n  // write out to the file\n}\n\nAbove is a simple Rust version.  If you've never seen Rust before, let's quickly break down it says:\n\nThe fn keyword creates our function\nNext, we give the function a name: writeToFile\nOur function gets one argument called 'name' which has the type &amp;str\n\n&amp;str is a type in two parts: \n\nstr is the simple string type\n&amp; meaning that this value is being borrowed and is owned by someone else (aka you're not allowed to delete it)\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we return something of type Result&lt;()&gt;\n\nResult&lt;()&gt; is the Rust way of saying I can return either:\n\na) successfully, without a value (the () above)\nb) an error\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rust example tells a bit more of the story than the C version.  In Rust, everything is immutable by default, so we know from looking at the signature that what we pass in can't be changed.  It also won't be deleted, because what is passed is 'borrowed' rather than us giving ownership over to this function.  Rust is similar to C in that we don't have exceptions and instead use return values to denote success or failure (read more in Rust Error Handling).  Rust encodes the success or failure in the return value, requiring the caller to code defensively around possible errors.  This has the effect of encouraging code to be more robust by handling both success and failure where they can occur.\nAn improvement over where we were in C, but we still have a lingering question: does this function have any permanent effect on the system?  To be able to answer that question, we go one example deeper down the rabbit hole.\nHaskell\nwriteToFile :: String -&gt; IO ()\nwriteToFile name = do \n\nSince this might be unfamiliar let's take a second to breakdown what we're seeing:\n\nWe start by declaring the type (which isn't terribly dissimilar from a forward declaration in C)\nThe type has two parts:\n\nWe take one argument that has a type String\nWe return an IO () [see below]\n\n\nAfter the type, we write out the actual implementation of the function\nJust as in Rust, Haskell is immutable by default.  When we say we pass in a String, we're also implying that this string can't be changed or deleted.\n\nAlso similar to Rust, in Haskell there are no exceptions, so you must handle all possible values when you call the function.  By saying IO (), this might at first seem similar to the Result&lt;()&gt;.  In some sense, it is, in that IO carries along any possible errors.\nIt also goes a bit further.  In essence, it says: \"I'm going to go change the world, and when I come back you need to carry that truth on.\"  In Haskell, if you call a function that performs I/O like our writeToFile function, you must also carry on that fact in your own return type.  You have to be fully transparent all the way through the call stack of who is changing the world, even indirectly.  This lets you clearly document who is modifying the world and who isn't.\nDark side of transparency\nBut, it can't be all roses, right?  Let's look at what I see as the dark side of transparency: encapsulation (or its lack thereof).\nAs good software engineers, we know an important piece of building a system is having good encapsulation.  Any module or object worth its weight exposes only necessary functionality to the world and hides the rest.  This encourages loose coupling, so that components don't depend on each others' implementation details.\nIn a way, transparency in the type runs counter to information hiding in that it encourages more coupling in the code.  Some of this is natural.  For example, in the C code, we have to remember what the return values are.  If we add a new one, we may have to change the code handling the call as well.  Likewise, in Python, if we change the types of parameters we allow, we may have to go update the callers.\nOn the other hand, knowing that a function may fail may be sufficient.  In the Rust case, code that handles the call may need to be updated if you change how the function fails, even if it only cares about if it fails.\nLikewise, in Haskell you may want to drop some probe into your system to catch the result of a function while you're debugging.  Such changes can have a ripple effect in your codebase as this probe may change a series of function calls to reflect that I/O has been performed.  (Not withstanding workarounds with fun names like unsafePerformIO)\nAll a balance\nTypes are there to help.  Leaning on them not enough means encoding more information in your tests and code comments.  Leaning on them too much may mean tightly coupling parts of your system.  What the right balance is may change from project to project, or developer to developer.\nJust as in our relationships with other people, it makes sense to not tell everyone we meet everything about us.  It's a balance.  Finding the right amount of transparency that encourages flexible, resilient systems is an art.\nIn the last few weeks, in playing with Rust more I've grown to appreciate its pragmatic set of trade-offs.  Yes, you don't get to know if the system was changed, but if something can impact the rest of the program, you're encouraged to handle it.  Not that there aren't workarounds or ways to easily opt-out, but just as in life, it's all a balance. \n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/telling-truth-in-code-function/","title":"Telling the truth in code, function signatures and transparency"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/the-fallow-year/":{"body":"Definition: fallow: (of agricultural land) Ploughed but left unseeded for more than one planting season.\nRust is an amazing project. It's unlike anything I've ever seen. Not only are we seeing an ever-growing number of big name users of Rust, we also continue to see leaps in productivity and functionality. Yesterday, the Rust 2018 edition shipped. The culmination of three years of work, it shows off what the community is capable of: new features, backwards compatibility, new ergonomics without sacrificing performance, and the list goes on and on.\nWhich is why it might comes as a little bit of a surprise that I suggest we let the field rest for the year. More specifically, that we should let one field rest while we plant another.\nRather than focusing on new designs, I suggest we turn our attention outside of RFCs to other areas of Rust.\nExamples\nThe compiler: The compiler team has been understaffed while also being heavily taxed by the effort of keeping up with new designs. I think they've done a stellar job with the resources they have, but they need help -- and lots of it. RFCs have gone unimplemented simply because not enough people are contributing. Compile times need work. The compiler team is generally too busy to implement core functionality that it hoped to get done this year, like compiler-drive IDE completions.\nLet's clear through the backlog of the growing list of accepted RFCs. Let's take the time to do the deep refactoring that we haven't had time to do because we were stretched too thin. Let's give ourselves space to experiment with new ways of doing things. Let's get the compiler ready to serve both build and IDE scenarios.\nRLS and related tools: We've had big success with projects like rustfmt, and it would be great to mirror that success in the Rust Language Server, or RLS, which powers Rust's IDE support. Unfortunately, the current RLS has to rely on many hacks to work with what is available from the compiler. By freeing up the compiler team, we also give space to the dev tools team to collaborate and finish the RLS, removing the need for hacks that cause incomplete functionality and unpredictabilty. \nThe community: That's right, the community needs a pause too. Everyone loves new features, but we need a bit of time to let all the new ones sink in before we start designing more. What design patterns will arise in practice? What are the best ways to work with async code at scale? On and on. Getting all this experience will let us see more clearly where to design next.\nDocumentation, videos, and other materials: Along with the growing knowledge the community is getting by more using the current Rust more deeply, we can also translate this knowledge into more documentation. The need is strong for mid-level Rust developer documentation. What are the Rust design patterns? How does one get the most benefit from Rust quickly? How does one translate C++ knowedge to Rust? And so on.\nLibraries: We can use the knowledge we have to create new and better libraries. Existing libraries could continue to mature and adopt Rust 2018 idioms. Areas like GUI development need some clear direction and focus.\nOutreach: We've worked on some outreach to companies who might be interested in Rust, but there's more we can do here. New whitepapers, new documentation about how to use Rust in specific sub-fields, like finance, data mining, machine learning, etc. \nThe list\nAs it turns out, these aren't my ideas. They're yours.\nThis year's Rust survey results highlighted these areas of improvement (sorted by number of comments):\n\nthe need for better library support\na more improved IDE experience\nthe need for broader adoption of Rust generally\na richer ecosystem of tools and support\nan improved learning curve\nthe need for important language features and crates to be stable and supported\nsupport for async programming\nsupport for GUI development\nbetter documentation\nimproved compile times\n\nYou'll notice that only one of these, \"support for async programming\", implies adding new functionality to Rust itself. Rather than asking for new features, users wanted better documentation, tools, library support, IDE support, learning materials, and overall stability. \nThe idea\nLet's finish what we started. As much as is possible and practical this year, let's set aside new designs and ship what we've already designed. Let's tackle challenges we haven't had time to give our full attention.\nIn short, let's grow Rust where it needs it most.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/the-fallow-year/","title":"The Fallow Year, my Rust2019 post"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/travel-log-blacksburg/":{"body":"This is the first of posts detailing my current trip, which will take me around southwest Virginia, Seattle, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Japan.\nMy first stop was Blacksburg, home of Virginia Tech.  I lived in Blacksburg from 1996 - 2009, so it was both familiar and a little alien, as it hasn't stood still since I've been gone.  Still, a great time to reconnect with friends that I haven't seen in years.\nVirginia Tech\n\nTorgersen Hall at Virginia Tech\nIt was nice to take a stroll around campus and see all the familiar buildings.  Even new building felt familiar with the use of Hokie Stone, a distinctive limestone taken from the local quarries.\nThe students were just coming back from Thanksgiving break, so when I first got here there were very few people around, giving it a ghost town feeling.  Not in a bad way, though.  I found it peaceful and quiet.\n\nWar Memorial Chapel\nWhen you're walking around the Tech campus, you can't help but notice the Burruss Hall building.  It's a giant building that is both familiar and imposing.  If you've seen any brochures about Virginia Tech, it's likely you've already seen it.\n\nStaring up at Burruss Hall\nIf you step back from Burruss Hall and look down, you'll notice a ring of stones.  This is the memorial for those killed in the shootings on April 16, 2007.  Each stone has a name of someone who was killed that day.\n\nRather than feeling overtly sad, the memorial feels more like a place to recognize and pay respect to the lost while at the same time giving the living space to move on and go about their lives.  Still, the losses are felt, and the lost remembered.\n\nBlacksburg\n\nLook out at Blackburg from the Virginia Tech library\nVirginia Tech is surrounded by the town of Blacksburg.  It's a fairly small affair, nestled into the hills of Virginia.  Downtown Blacksburg is only a few streets wide, with a few dozen restaurants and shops packed together before the streets stretch into the neighboring residential areas.\nBecause of its relatively small size, the student population inevitably develops a fondness for certain restaurants.  Some of these became institutions that would go on to serve each new batch of students.  One such institution is the Bollo's cafe and bakery.\n\nBollo's, a Blacksburg institution (with photogenic dog)\nIt was good to see that it's still around.  As an undergrad student at Virginia Tech, I spent many a night here laughing with friends, going on dates, playing games, and drinking the strongest coffee I'd ever had.  Sorry Seattle, you weren't my first latte.\nSpeaking of Seattle, which is currently being swallowed by the efficient apartment complex, Blacksburg still has lots of great houses in prime locations.  The house I'm staying in is rich with character, created sometime in the early 1900s.  Its heating has been modernized, but it still has the history intact.  In the basement is a shower for the field workers to wash off.\n\nIt was great to see my Blacksburg friends again.  It felt like taking a slow bath in the familiar before rising to walk off to the unknown.  A perfect way to start the trip.  I can't wait to see what adventures lie ahead.\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/travel-log-blacksburg/","title":"Travel log (Blacksburg)"},"https://www.jntrnr.com/travel-log-maui/":{"body":"When I left Seattle, I jokingly told my friend \"the first country I'm travelling to is Hawaii\".\n\"But it is isn't a different country,\" she replied.\nIt is.  Oh it is.\n\nLooking at Maui from the Kula Lodge\nHaving travelled around the United States, I can't say there are many places even similar to Hawaii.  Or, more precisely, Maui, the island I spent most of my time on this past week.\nTo start with many of the views look absolutely, totally fake.  Yes, the above picture was my view at lunch one day.  Only after staying in Maui for a week did I start to get used to the fact that driving around the interior of Maui, at any moment you could turn the corner and see another breath-taking view.\nI don't know if I could get used to it really.  Half my shots of the beach or looking out over the mountain look like they're from a postcard.\n\nKamaole Beach III\nSure, I guess someone might over time get used to the amazing mixture of volcanic rock, perfect beaches, and mountain views rounded out with gorgeous weather.  Add to that easy access to a wide variety of fresh produce and fish, and you have yourself a quite literal slice of paradise.  It became quickly obvious why Hawaii has its reputation.  It is, quite simply, nothing short of amazing.\nTo give it an even more foreign feel, I was greeted by a number of foods and plants I'd never heard of before.  Fruit that tastes like cinnamon (complete with a gritty texture), starfruit, and even the plentyful macadamia nuts used in new ways (like in the crust on Mahi Mahi, for example).\nSpeaking of macadamia nuts...\n\nLike I said, a variety of foods.  The plants, too, came in all shapes and sizes.  One of the most striking is the Rainbow Eucalyptus.\n\nRainbow Eucalyptus at Garden of Eden\nThe above picture is from the Garden of Eden on the Road to Hana.  Both the Garden and the Road to Hana are well worth exploring.  The Road is a windy affair that takes you around through some of the various micro-climates as you traverse the island.  My friend and I explored it one day, stopping at the Garden of Eden, a nature reserve that contained many cool varieties of plants, including the Rainbow Eucalyptus above.  In addition, many varieties of bamboo, bananas, flowers of various sorts, and starfruit flourish.\nBut you don't really have to go very far in any direction to get the island experience.\n\nMaui, as one may expect being a holiday spot for many, is a great reminder to take things a little slower.  Stop and look at the flowers, enjoy the views, soak in the sun, and rest up for whatever adventure might come along tomorrow.  There's also a general friendly, caring spirit that people generally strive for called the Aloha Spirit, sharing its name with the famous greeting.  As a sense of goodwill, it carries through the island's inhabitants and even into governance.  Just as important as soaking in the sun is to soak in some of the Aloha while you're there and take it with you.\n\nI'm looking forward to returning to Hawaii and seeing what else it has to offer.  Like many places, it feels like I just scratched the surface.  What I found was a warm, welcoming place, both in temperature and in vibe.  Highly recommended checking it out.  It's well-worth the flight.  Just don't rush too much, or you'll miss some of the best parts.\nMahalo for reading!\n","id":"https://www.jntrnr.com/travel-log-maui/","title":"Travel log (Maui)"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.jntrnr.com/":{"body":2,"title":0},"https://www.jntrnr.com/building-a-simple-jit-in-rust/":{"body":821,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-traits/":{"body":786,"title":6},"https://www.jntrnr.com/embedded-scripting-in-rust/":{"body":1065,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/exit-codes/":{"body":456,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/fun-facts-about-rust-growth/":{"body":1087,"title":5},"https://www.jntrnr.com/handmadecon-2015/":{"body":959,"title":2},"https://www.jntrnr.com/helping-out-with-rust-errors/":{"body":1536,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/how-fast-can-we-compile-rust-hello-world/":{"body":1695,"title":5},"https://www.jntrnr.com/how-we-talk-about-rust-in-2018/":{"body":527,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/intermedia-rust-series/":{"body":275,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/introducing-nushell/":{"body":1565,"title":2},"https://www.jntrnr.com/learning-to-try-things-in-rust/":{"body":680,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/lessons-from-first-12-euler-problems-in/":{"body":2875,"title":6},"https://www.jntrnr.com/nushell-0-3-0/":{"body":437,"title":2},"https://www.jntrnr.com/nushell-0-4-0/":{"body":429,"title":2},"https://www.jntrnr.com/nushell-0-5-0/":{"body":604,"title":2},"https://www.jntrnr.com/off-to-new-adventures/":{"body":119,"title":2},"https://www.jntrnr.com/porting-csharp-nes-emu-to-rust/":{"body":960,"title":5},"https://www.jntrnr.com/porting-the-pikachu/":{"body":474,"title":5},"https://www.jntrnr.com/programming-language-and-compilers-reading-list/":{"body":562,"title":5},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rethinking-the-blub-paradox/":{"body":348,"title":5},"https://www.jntrnr.com/retiring/":{"body":229,"title":1},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rhai-02/":{"body":187,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-alpha-2/":{"body":293,"title":6},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-alpha-release/":{"body":519,"title":6},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rls-now-in-nightly/":{"body":177,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-and-blub-paradox/":{"body":1627,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-in-windows/":{"body":554,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust-quickie-matching-strings/":{"body":125,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/rust2018-and-data/":{"body":458,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/scripting-languages-of-the-future/":{"body":600,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/snapshot-of-rust-popularity/":{"body":819,"title":5},"https://www.jntrnr.com/starting-the-next-thing/":{"body":197,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/steam-machines/":{"body":943,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/telling-truth-in-code-function/":{"body":782,"title":6},"https://www.jntrnr.com/the-fallow-year/":{"body":441,"title":4},"https://www.jntrnr.com/travel-log-blacksburg/":{"body":323,"title":3},"https://www.jntrnr.com/travel-log-maui/":{"body":329,"title":3}},"length":39},"lang":"English"};
