To my dearest soul 
------------------

I have come back to the beginning 
I left in search of adventure 
Leaving hearth and home 
For rugged wilds and rough seas 
Using my broken compass that always pointed 'away' 
I met the mudslingers and love givers  
Yet no arms returned me to you 
After victories sung high from mountains 
Carved out of the land by many defeats 
I see a terrain just as foreign 

You, my soul, ached for home 
I heeded the call, back across the scarred land 
Back to the familiar streams 
When finally my feet found the intimate soil 
Of the beginning 
I saw that it, too, had changed 

In my sad reverie, a thought arose 
I had carried a piece of it with me the whole journey 
It was you, my soul, forged from stars before this land was born 
It is you, my star, who will guide me on.

I want to give up 
----------------------

I want to give up 
This suit I was born in
Compared to this skin-tight white tuxedo
My other clothes are just rags 

This suit opens doors 
Opens halls 
Gives a platform to my untrained voice 
Hands me the unearned megaphone 

I want to shrug off this birthday suit 
Drop it to the floor and come out
Sinew and bone 
Stripping until I'm down to the clay

Maybe as clay we could rebuild a better world 
One without whips, 
without classes, 
without blood feeding the soil 

We are all just clay 
It's time we remembered how to act like it.

Those spots 
-----------

Those spots in you that you're afraid of. 
That darkness inside of you. 
It's actually not evil at all. 
It's just darkness. 
Units of space yet to be filled. 

*Mar 2, 2015* 

Lives like streams 
------------------

How afraid we become 
Such tight grips we have as darkness passes overhead 
Lest we loosen 
And risk catastrophe
Lest we experience 
What lies beyond the mind's fumbling sight 

The hills ahead obscure our view 
When will this shadow take us? 

Lives like streams 
They will find a way 

Loosen your obstinate control 
For you never had it 
A fool holds the water tightly 
Hoping to choke the stream 

Does death come and take us? 
Death is no sharp knife 
Death is change 

When the stream flows inside you
Fall into it 
Let it carry you 
Each fear, a leaf 
In a mighty river

Poem for Anna
-------------

Call me sentimental 
I just wanted to stop and write a little 
To put to this digital page a feeling I've been scratching at 

There is substance to us 
To each of us and to the us that is us 
I can't draw a line around it, to guess its form 
Yet its function is clear 
We are here, to share and embrace 
That dear warm soul buried in our bellies 
To encourage it to glow, to fan its embers, to feel its flow 
To remember that generations before us 
Who shared these bones 
Carried around in them, like hallowed tomes 
Knowledge of the subtle world around them 

Let us unlock these secrets together 
With the sweetie call of the chickadee 
Let us sing these thoughts out of their dark corners 
And embrace ourselves, light and shadow 
Slowly losing all that's callow and shallow 
Deepening in a silly, warm honey spirit 
That alights on our irises, our heart, our crown 
Taking in each day, whether high or down 
Folding each in our hearts, cushioned by the soft ground 

Our great mother's life green hairs blow in the breeze 
Our great mother's sandy skin 
In our toes, all over our feet 
Her shells, her shores, the blue green pools of her eyes 
A long, slow stare into the depths of our minds 

We are small, but 
We are like this 
We are change 
We are vital 
We are finite bodies and yet great mystery 
We are a reflection of her 
With our shores 
With our seas 

We are the teenagers playing in a great, wondrous cosmos 
We are its crown and root 
The size of a speck of dust 

Let us dance together 
You and I 
Dust to dust 
Let us dance the spiral, dance and whirl 
Turning with the rhythm of this world 
Tuning our breaths 
Our heartbeats 
Beating the beats with our dirty clean feet 
Letting our voices pass in and out of phase 
Like some phrase in a round 
Each time around to a place we've been 
We see more than just our prints 
Other spirits have been dancing with us, too 
Calling us forward 
Saying "come, good children, feast on the great unknown" 
But there is no supper, and when we look for them, the spirits have gone 
And all that is left are shipping crates and traffic sounds 

This is our dance, the sublime and the life lived  
Counted in human days 

Listening in the quiet 
Embracing when we can 
Embracing in the quiet 
Listening when we can 

Let us celebrate each good step 
Let us nurse each step that falters 
Perhaps when we've walked this path farther 
And danced these steps longer 
We'll look back and in our minds eye 
We'll at last see the grand design.

The inevitable cycle 
--------------------

I sit down to have a meal 
Whether bland or sweet 
When I get up the table is cleared 

*Jun 8, 2017* 

Beloved
-------
 
Celebrate the people you are close to 
Deeply 
Thoroughly 
There is no moment that lasts forever

Friends, mentors, parents, partners 
I take you all to me 
I fit you in my heart 
I will make room 

For you made room for me when I was small and scared 
You taught me and helped me grow

I will hold your cold hand 
To shock me awake 
To remember what a thousand generations before me knew 
Death comes for us all 
Each and every one 
May we all love
And be beloved. 

*Mar 21, 2015*
 
Outside my window 
-----------------

Outside my window 
Nature beckons
Why do I refuse?

The trees know what I need 
They've been watching day after day 
Come sit with us 
Let us teach you a slower way 
Practice under our branches 
So you can awaken to a deeper life 
 
*Aug 29, 2016*
 
Squirming to life
-----------------

Feel the soul within squirming to life 
Feel your umbilical cord to it 
Be pregnant with yourself 
Care for it 
Feed it
Watch it grow
For it is precious 
It is you. 

*July 26, 2016*

There sits this 
---------------
 
There sits this 
Soft shadow upon my heart 
Is it the passing grief 
Of loved ones lost 
Or the sombre tones 
Of shallow moans 
And the time they cost? 
How do we measure 
Life's big loss 
Not in longing sighs 
Nor the strain of blinking eyes 

This tear has a weight all its own 
Spoken from a tongue all its own
Fighting the apathy that will rob us all 
Of a life realized.

Why is my faith so small?
-------------------------

Why is my faith so small?
Why so little, little bird? 
A canary of such cheer and yet
How easily you're snuffed out when the waves of doubt arise

How do I water you?
How do I feed this small belly? 
How do you grow stout and barrel-chested? 
Able to resist the arrows, and stand having bested 
Each doubt and barb. 
I feel like I've neglected you for far too long. 

Let me repent 
Though my words will fall like noise 
On your perfect bird ears.

I've forgotten your songs 
Teach me them again
I'll be quiet, little bird
Show me the way home.

The wasp
--------

Ouch!
Get it off!

My hand moves
My mind yells
And a minute later I wonder
Should I have thanked the wasp that stung me?

It hurt and the hurt held on 
But my self-absorption cracked 
For there, after I jerked away 
Was an insect so blameless 
And I so large, so ready to destroy moments before 
Felt acceptance 

There was no malice in the mark it left
No cause for alarm 
It is merely that I have pinched myself in the gears of the world.

*Jan 17, 2018*

Breathing 
---------

Tonight I thought for sure I would stop breathing 
That my lungs would cease and no longer expand 
Shriveled up prune mere minutes from now 
Goodbye. You've been so kind. 
As a parting gift I'll blow you a kiss 
In my mind.  

Why does my mind think I'm dying 
Why do I have to ignore it, 
Ignore these fears 
Distract myself 
With the hope I'll catch myself 
Breathing normally an hour from now. 

Do I have cancer? 
Are my lungs punctured? 
Are they frail and ready to tear? 
Is this asthma?
Or a hint of pneumonia? 

Still breathing normally 
I just realized
Haven't died in the time it took to write this 
Perhaps I'll sleep through the night 
And awaken surprised.

*Nov 28, 2017*

Who am I 
--------

Who am I  
To try a feeble attempt 
At putting to page 
What our love meant 
To me, to my life, to the way I see the world 

Had I any idea of the capacity inside 
Or the path to get here 
I would have been a prophet 
But as it is 
I'm a fool  
A mere amateur of love 
Fumbling to capture a glimpse 
Of this soul to soul touching 

Perhaps you think me a romantic 
A sanguine jester doomed to stumble 
In a childish pursuit 
Of writing a poem of love 

But on days like these 
When I glimpse what has happened inside 
I open up 

Like a flower drinking in the sun 
Bare and unashamed 
Learning all I need 
Watching the sky above 

For if it is the bluest blue 
Or laden clouds of imminent rain 
We will watch it together 
Whether waves of pain or pleasure 
Fall upon our lives 
Leaving us soaked or thirsty for more 
We will see where this goes 
Where each turn of the Earth takes us 

I'll take these foolish steps 
Hand in hand 
Ignorantly charging ahead 
Not knowing what we'll know 
For who could know 
What we'll create 
Until we do.

Many deaths at the feet of my teacher 
-------------------------------------

When I sought my teacher in the cave at the top of the mountain 
I said 

"Master, I know in my heart you are my teacher 
I will wait at the mouth of the cave 
Until you call me in." 

I waited, day and night, but the teacher did not call. 

"I must have faith," I told myself 

Still, I weakened 
Until at last, as my eyes closed, 
I heard a voice saying 

"Have you not learned the first lesson? 
Come again when you remember that you must never cede your choice to another" 
With that, I died. 

In my next life, 
I climbed the mountain, carrying with me a great pack 
At the top, I called to the teacher 

"Master, I will stay here and wait. 
If I must leave, I will return again. 
For the wisdom you provide 
Is more valuable than my life of ignorance." 

A voice called from the cave, 

"I am but a fool who lives in a cave,  
What wisdom could I provide?" 

"But Master," I replied 
"Stories of your great wisdom 
Spread wide through the valleys below." 

The teacher snorted. 
"Can the dwellers of the valleys below 
Judge what is great wisdom?" 

To this I remained silent 
For though I loved many people in the valleys 
None was a great master. 

"And how will you, traveller,  
Judge what is great wisdom?" 

With those words, the teacher said no more. 

That night, a great storm came. 
The cold was so great, it reached my heart. 
With that, I died. 

In my next life, 
I climbed the mountain and carried a light pack 
At the top, I called to the teacher 

"Respected cave dweller, 
I have travelled the valleys below 
In search of uncommon wisdom. 

"I have met many who claim to be great, 
But when I looked closely 
I saw they were no more wise than common folk. 

"When I had good fortune, 
Wise words would be given to me in my travels, 
I cherished them and sought yet more. 

"Those who spoke wise words told me of this cave, 
Though I know not if you will take a student." 

After a moment, the teacher exited the cave and spoke 

"What do I know of the ways of the valley? 
Why do you want to know the ways of a cave?" 

I bowed, and spoke 

"Respected cave dweller, 
Though I have searched the valleys below, 
I have found life to be hollow. 
Perhaps high above the valleys, 
You have found a life that is full." 

The teacher laughed and spat 
A hearty clarion that pierced my ears. 

"Are you like a cat, climbing up for a better view? 

"What if wisdom lives far north of the valleys? 
Would you find it here? 
Or perhaps great wisdom lies far south? 
Or is it to the east? 
Or to the west? 

"Perhaps wisdom is found 
Digging deep into the earth of the valleys below. 
Would you find it here?" 

The teacher returned to the cave. 

Knowing my supplies were low, 
I descended the mountain, 
But in my haste travelled too quickly, 
And I fell from a great height. 
With that, I died. 

In my next life, I searched the valleys, 
I searched north of the valleys, 
I searched south of the valleys, 
I searched to the east and to the west. 

When at last I returned, my body hurt. 
My frame was not that of youth
I bent as I climbed towards the cave. 

At the top, a terrible wind blew, 
Without hesitating, I entered the cave, 
And called out a welcome. 

When I heard no reply, 
I closed my eyes to rest.
